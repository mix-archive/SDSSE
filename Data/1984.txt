2	it was a bright cold day in april and the clocks were striking thirteen
3	winston smith his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him
4	the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats
5	at one end of it a coloured poster too large for indoor display had been tacked to the wall
6	it depicted simply an enormous face more than a metre wide the face of a man of about fortyfive with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features
7	winston made for the stairs
8	it was no use trying the lift
9	even at the best of times it was seldom working and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours
10	it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week
11	the flat was seven flights up and winston who was thirtynine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle went slowly resting several times on the way
12	on each landing opposite the liftshaft the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall
13	it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move
14	big brother is watching you the caption beneath it ran
15	inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pigiron
16	the voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the righthand wall
17	winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat though the words were still distinguishable
18	the instrument the telescreen it was called could be dimmed but there was no way of shutting it off completely
19	he moved over to the window a smallish frail figure the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party
20	his hair was very fair his face naturally sanguine his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended
21	outside even through the shut windowpane the world looked cold
22	down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue there seemed to be no colour in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere
23	the blackmoustachiod face gazed down from every commanding corner
24	there was one on the housefront immediately opposite
25	big brother is watching you the caption said while the dark eyes looked deep into winstons own
26	down at street level another poster torn at one corner flapped fitfully in the wind alternately covering and uncovering the single word ingsoc
27	in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs hovered for an instant like a bluebottle and darted away again with a curving flight
28	it was the police patrol snooping into peoples windows
29	the patrols did not matter however
30	only the thought police mattered
31	behind winstons back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pigiron and the overfulfilment of the ninth threeyear plan
32	the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously
33	any sound that winston made above the level of a very low whisper would be picked up by it moreover so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded he could be seen as well as heard
34	there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment
35	how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork
36	it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time
37	but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to
38	you had to livedid live from habit that became instinctin the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
39	winston kept his back turned to the telescreen
40	it was safer though as he well knew even a back can be revealing
41	a kilometre away the ministry of truth his place of work towered vast and white above the grimy landscape
42	this he thought with a sort of vague distastethis was london chief city of airstrip one itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania
43	he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this
44	were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenthcentury houses their sides shored up with baulks of timber their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions
45	and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willowherb straggled over the heaps of rubble and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chickenhouses
46	but it was no use he could not remember nothing remained of his childhood except a series of brightlit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible
47	the ministry of truthminitrue in newspeak newspeak was the official language of oceania
48	for an account of its structure and etymology see appendix
49	was startlingly different from any other object in sight
50	it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete soaring up terrace after terrace metres into the air
51	from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party
52	war is peace
53	freedom is slavery
54	ignorance is strength
55	the ministry of truth contained it was said three thousand rooms above ground level and corresponding ramifications below
56	scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size
57	so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously
58	they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided
59	the ministry of truth which concerned itself with news entertainment education and the fine arts
60	the ministry of peace which concerned itself with war
61	the ministry of love which maintained law and order
62	and the ministry of plenty which was responsible for economic affairs
63	their names in newspeak minitrue minipax miniluv and miniplenty
64	the ministry of love was the really frightening one
65	there were no windows in it at all
66	winston had never been inside the ministry of love nor within half a kilometre of it
67	it was a place impossible to enter except on official business and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbedwire entanglements steel doors and hidden machinegun nests
68	even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorillafaced guards in black uniforms armed with jointed truncheons
69	winston turned round abruptly
70	he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen
71	he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen
72	by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of darkcoloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrows breakfast
73	he took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin
74	it gave off a sickly oily smell as of chinese ricespirit
75	winston poured out nearly a teacupful nerved himself for a shock and gulped it down like a dose of medicine
76	instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes
77	the stuff was like nitric acid and moreover in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club
78	the next moment however the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful
79	he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor
80	with the next he was more successful
81	he went back to the livingroom and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen
82	from the table drawer he took out a penholder a bottle of ink and a thick quartosized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover
83	for some reason the telescreen in the livingroom was in an unusual position
84	instead of being placed as was normal in the end wall where it could command the whole room it was in the longer wall opposite the window
85	to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting and which when the flats were built had probably been intended to hold bookshelves
86	by sitting in the alcove and keeping well back winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen so far as sight went
87	he could be heard of course but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen
88	it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do
89	but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer
90	it was a peculiarly beautiful book
91	its smooth creamy paper a little yellowed by age was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past
92	he could guess however that the book was much older than that
93	he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junkshop in a slummy quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it
94	party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops dealing on the free market it was called but the rule was not strictly kept because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way
95	he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty
96	at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose
97	he had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase
98	even with nothing written in it it was a compromising possession
99	the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary
100	this was not illegal nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death or at least by twentyfive years in a forcedlabour camp
101	winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off
102	the pen was an archaic instrument seldom used even for signatures and he had procured one furtively and with some difficulty simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an inkpencil
103	actually he was not used to writing by hand
104	apart from very short notes it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose
105	he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second
106	a tremor had gone through his bowels
107	to mark the paper was the decisive act
108	in small clumsy letters he wrote
109	april th
110	he sat back
111	a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him
112	to begin with he did not know with any certainty that this was
113	it must be round about that date since he was fairly sure that his age was thirtynine and he believed that he had been born in or but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two
114	for whom it suddenly occurred to him to wonder was he writing this diary
115	for the future for the unborn
116	his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page and then fetched up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink
117	for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him
118	how could you communicate with the future
119	it was of its nature impossible
120	either the future would resemble the present in which case it would not listen to him or it would be different from it and his predicament would be meaningless
121	for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper
122	the telescreen had changed over to strident military music
123	it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say
124	for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage
125	the actual writing would be easy
126	all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head literally for years
127	at this moment however even the monologue had dried up
128	moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably
129	he dared not scratch it because if he did so it always became inflamed
130	the seconds were ticking by
131	he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him the itching of the skin above his ankle the blaring of the music and a slight booziness caused by the gin
132	suddenly he began writing in sheer panic only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down
133	his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops
134	april th
135	last night to the flicks
136	all war films
137	one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean
138	audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank
139	then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it
140	there was a middleaged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms
141	little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him
142	then the helicopter planted a kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood
143	then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never
144	winston stopped writing partly because he was suffering from cramp
145	he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish
146	but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down
147	it was he now realized because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today
148	it had happened that morning at the ministry if anything so nebulous could be said to happen
149	it was nearly eleven hundred and in the records department where winston worked they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen in preparation for the two minutes hate
150	winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight but had never spoken to came unexpectedly into the room
151	one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors
152	he did not know her name but he knew that she worked in the fiction department
153	presumablysince he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spannershe had some mechanical job on one of the novelwriting machines
154	she was a boldlooking girl of about twentyseven with thick hair a freckled face and swift athletic movements
155	a narrow scarlet sash emblem of the junior antisex league was wound several times round the waist of her overalls just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips
156	winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her
157	he knew the reason
158	it was because of the atmosphere of hockeyfields and cold baths and community hikes and general cleanmindedness which she managed to carry about with her
159	he disliked nearly all women and especially the young and pretty ones
160	it was always the women and above all the young ones who were the most bigoted adherents of the party the swallowers of slogans the amateur spies and nosersout of unorthodoxy
161	but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most
162	once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror
163	the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police
164	that it was true was very unlikely
165	still he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility whenever she was anywhere near him
166	the other person was a man named obrien a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature
167	a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching
168	obrien was a large burly man with a thick neck and a coarse humorous brutal face
169	in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner
170	he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarmingin some indefinable way curiously civilized
171	it was a gesture which if anyone had still thought in such terms might have recalled an eighteenthcentury nobleman offering his snuffbox
172	winston had seen obrien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years
173	he felt deeply drawn to him and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between obriens urbane manner and his prizefighters physique
174	much more it was because of a secretly held beliefor perhaps not even a belief merely a hopethat obriens political orthodoxy was not perfect
175	something in his face suggested it irresistibly
176	and again perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face but simply intelligence
177	but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone
178	winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess indeed there was no way of doing so
179	at this moment obrien glanced at his wristwatch saw that it was nearly eleven hundred and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over
180	he took a chair in the same row as winston a couple of places away
181	a small sandyhaired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them
182	the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind
183	the next moment a hideous grinding speech as of some monstrous machine running without oil burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room
184	it was a noise that set ones teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of ones neck
185	the hate had started
186	as usual the face of emmanuel goldstein the enemy of the people had flashed on to the screen
187	there were hisses here and there among the audience
188	the little sandyhaired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust
189	goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once long ago how long ago nobody quite remembered had been one of the leading figures of the party almost on a level with big brother himself and then had engaged in counterrevolutionary activities had been condemned to death and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared
190	the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure
191	he was the primal traitor the earliest defiler of the partys purity
192	all subsequent crimes against the party all treacheries acts of sabotage heresies deviations sprang directly out of his teaching
193	somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies perhaps somewhere beyond the sea under the protection of his foreign paymasters perhaps evenso it was occasionally rumouredin some hidingplace in oceania itself
194	winstons diaphragm was constricted
195	he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions
196	it was a lean jewish face with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee bearda clever face and yet somehow inherently despicable with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched
197	it resembled the face of a sheep and the voice too had a sheeplike quality
198	goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the partyan attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people less levelheaded than oneself might be taken in by it
199	he was abusing big brother he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia he was advocating freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of thought he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayedand all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party and even contained newspeak words more newspeak words indeed than any party member would normally use in real life
200	and all the while lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldsteins specious claptrap covered behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian armyrow after row of solidlooking men with expressionless asiatic faces who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished to be replaced by others exactly similar
201	the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots formed the background to goldsteins bleating voice
202	before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room
203	the selfsatisfied sheeplike face on the screen and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it were too much to be borne besides the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically
204	he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other
205	but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody although every day and a thousand times a day on platforms on the telescreen in newspapers in books his theories were refuted smashed ridiculed held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they werein spite of all this his influence never seemed to grow less
206	always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him
207	a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police
208	he was the commander of a vast shadowy army an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state
209	the brotherhood its name was supposed to be
210	there were also whispered stories of a terrible book a compendium of all the heresies of which goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there
211	it was a book without a title
212	people referred to it if at all simply as the book
213	but one knew of such things only through vague rumours
214	neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it
215	in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy
216	people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen
217	the little sandyhaired woman had turned bright pink and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish
218	even obriens heavy face was flushed
219	he was sitting very straight in his chair his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave
220	the darkhaired girl behind winston had begun crying out swine
221	swine
222	swine
223	and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen
224	it struck goldsteins nose and bounced off the voice continued inexorably
225	in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair
226	the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part but on the contrary that it was impossible to avoid joining in
227	within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary
228	a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledgehammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against ones will into a grimacing screaming lunatic
229	and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
230	thus at one moment winstons hatred was not turned against goldstein at all but on the contrary against big brother the party and the thought police and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely derided heretic on the screen sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies
231	and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true
232	at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into adoration and big brother seemed to tower up an invincible fearless protector standing like a rock against the hordes of asia and goldstein in spite of his isolation his helplessness and the doubt that hung about his very existence seemed like some sinister enchanter capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization
233	it was even possible at moments to switch ones hatred this way or that by a voluntary act
234	suddenly by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches ones head away from the pillow in a nightmare winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the darkhaired girl behind him
235	vivid beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind
236	he would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon
237	he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian
238	he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax
239	better than before moreover he realized why it was that he hated her
240	he hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so because round her sweet supple waist which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm there was only the odious scarlet sash aggressive symbol of chastity
241	the hate rose to its climax
242	the voice of goldstein had become an actual sheeps bleat and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep
243	then the sheepface melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing huge and terrible his submachine gun roaring and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats
244	but in the same moment drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother blackhaired blackmoustachiod full of power and mysterious calm and so vast that it almost filled up the screen
245	nobody heard what big brother was saying
246	it was merely a few words of encouragement the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken
247	then the face of big brother faded away again and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals
248	war is peace
249	freedom is slavery
250	ignorance is strength
251	but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen as though the impact that it had made on everyones eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately
252	the little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her
253	with a tremulous murmur that sounded like my saviour
254	she extended her arms towards the screen
255	then she buried her face in her hands
256	it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer
257	at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep slow rhythmical chant of bbbb
258	over and over again very slowly with a long pause between the first b and the seconda heavy murmurous sound somehow curiously savage in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tomtoms
259	for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up
260	it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion
261	partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother but still more it was an act of selfhypnosis a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise
262	winstons entrails seemed to grow cold
263	in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium but this subhuman chanting of bbbb
264	always filled him with horror
265	of course he chanted with the rest it was impossible to do otherwise
266	to dissemble your feelings to control your face to do what everyone else was doing was an instinctive reaction
267	but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him
268	and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happenedif indeed it did happen
269	momentarily he caught obriens eye
270	obrien had stood up
271	he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture
272	but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met and for as long as it took to happen winston knewyes he knewthat obrien was thinking the same thing as himself
273	an unmistakable message had passed
274	it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes
275	i am with you obrien seemed to be saying to him
276	i know precisely what you are feeling
277	i know all about your contempt your hatred your disgust
278	but dont worry i am on your side
279	and then the flash of intelligence was gone and obriens face was as inscrutable as everybody elses
280	that was all and he was already uncertain whether it had happened
281	such incidents never had any sequel
282	all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief or hope that others besides himself were the enemies of the party
283	perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after allperhaps the brotherhood really existed
284	it was impossible in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth
285	some days he believed in it some days not
286	there was no evidence only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing snatches of overheard conversation faint scribbles on lavatory wallsonce even when two strangers met a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition
287	it was all guesswork very likely he had imagined everything
288	he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at obrien again
289	the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind
290	it would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it
291	for a second two seconds they had exchanged an equivocal glance and that was the end of the story
292	but even that was a memorable event in the locked loneliness in which one had to live
293	winston roused himself and sat up straighter
294	he let out a belch
295	the gin was rising from his stomach
296	his eyes refocused on the page
297	he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing as though by automatic action
298	and it was no longer the same cramped awkward handwriting as before
299	his pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper printing in large neat capitals
300	down with big brother
301	down with big brother
302	down with big brother
303	down with big brother
304	down with big brother
305	over and over again filling half a page
306	he could not help feeling a twinge of panic
307	it was absurd since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether
308	he did not do so however because he knew that it was useless
309	whether he wrote down with big brother or whether he refrained from writing it made no difference
310	whether he went on with the diary or whether he did not go on with it made no difference
311	the thought police would get him just the same
312	he had committedwould still have committed even if he had never set pen to paperthe essential crime that contained all others in itself
313	thoughtcrime they called it
314	thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever
315	you might dodge successfully for a while even for years but sooner or later they were bound to get you
316	it was always at nightthe arrests invariably happened at night
317	the sudden jerk out of sleep the rough hand shaking your shoulder the lights glaring in your eyes the ring of hard faces round the bed
318	in the vast majority of cases there was no trial no report of the arrest
319	people simply disappeared always during the night
320	your name was removed from the registers every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out your onetime existence was denied and then forgotten
321	you were abolished annihilated vaporized was the usual word
322	for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria
323	he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl
324	theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother
325	he sat back in his chair slightly ashamed of himself and laid down the pen
326	the next moment he started violently
327	there was a knocking at the door
328	already
329	he sat as still as a mouse in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt
330	but no the knocking was repeated
331	the worst thing of all would be to delay
332	his heart was thumping like a drum but his face from long habit was probably expressionless
333	he got up and moved heavily towards the door
334	chapter
335	as he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table
336	down with big brother was written all over it in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room
337	it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done
338	but he realized even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet
339	he drew in his breath and opened the door
340	instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him
341	a colourless crushedlooking woman with wispy hair and a lined face was standing outside
342	oh comrade she began in a dreary whining sort of voice i thought i heard you come in
343	do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink
344	its got blocked up and
345	it was mrs parsons the wife of a neighbour on the same floor
346	mrs was a word somewhat discountenanced by the partyyou were supposed to call everyone comradebut with some women one used it instinctively
347	she was a woman of about thirty but looking much older
348	one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face
349	winston followed her down the passage
350	these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation
351	victory mansions were old flats built in or thereabouts and were falling to pieces
352	the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls the pipes burst in every hard frost the roof leaked whenever there was snow the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy
353	repairs except what you could do for yourself had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a windowpane for two years
354	of course its only because tom isnt home said mrs parsons vaguely
355	the parsons flat was bigger than winstons and dingy in a different way
356	everything had a battered trampledon look as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal
357	games impedimentahockeysticks boxinggloves a burst football a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside outlay all over the floor and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dogeared exercisebooks
358	on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies and a fullsized poster of big brother
359	there was the usual boiledcabbage smell common to the whole building but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat whichone knew this at the first sniff though it was hard to say howwas the sweat of some person not present at the moment
360	in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen
361	its the children said mrs parsons casting a halfapprehensive glance at the door
362	they havent been out today
363	and of course
364	she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle
365	the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage
366	winston knelt down and examined the anglejoint of the pipe
367	he hated using his hands and he hated bending down which was always liable to start him coughing
368	mrs parsons looked on helplessly
369	of course if tom was home hed put it right in a moment she said
370	he loves anything like that
371	hes ever so good with his hands tom is
372	parsons was winstons fellowemployee at the ministry of truth
373	he was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity a mass of imbecile enthusiasmsone of those completely unquestioning devoted drudges on whom more even than on the thought police the stability of the party depended
374	at thirtyfive he had just been unwillingly evicted from the youth league and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age
375	at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes spontaneous demonstrations savings campaigns and voluntary activities generally
376	he would inform you with quiet pride between whiffs of his pipe that he had put in an appearance at the community centre every evening for the past four years
377	an overpowering smell of sweat a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life followed him about wherever he went and even remained behind him after he had gone
378	have you got a spanner
379	said winston fiddling with the nut on the anglejoint
380	a spanner said mrs parsons immediately becoming invertebrate
381	i dont know im sure
382	perhaps the children
383	there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the livingroom
384	mrs parsons brought the spanner
385	winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe
386	he cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room
387	up with your hands
388	yelled a savage voice
389	a handsome toughlooking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol while his small sister about two years younger made the same gesture with a fragment of wood
390	both of them were dressed in the blue shorts grey shirts and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies
391	winston raised his hands above his head but with an uneasy feeling so vicious was the boys demeanour that it was not altogether a game
392	youre a traitor
393	yelled the boy
394	youre a thoughtcriminal
395	youre a eurasian spy
396	ill shoot you ill vaporize you ill send you to the salt mines
397	suddenly they were both leaping round him shouting traitor
398	and thoughtcriminal
399	the little girl imitating her brother in every movement
400	it was somehow slightly frightening like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into maneaters
401	there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boys eye a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so
402	it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding winston thought
403	mrs parsons eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children and back again
404	in the better light of the livingroom he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face
405	they do get so noisy she said
406	theyre disappointed because they couldnt go to see the hanging thats what it is
407	im too busy to take them
408	and tom wont be back from work in time
409	why cant we go and see the hanging
410	roared the boy in his huge voice
411	want to see the hanging
412	want to see the hanging
413	chanted the little girl still capering round
414	some eurasian prisoners guilty of war crimes were to be hanged in the park that evening winston remembered
415	this happened about once a month and was a popular spectacle
416	children always clamoured to be taken to see it
417	he took his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door
418	but he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow
419	it was as though a redhot wire had been jabbed into him
420	he spun round just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult
421	goldstein
422	bellowed the boy as the door closed on him
423	but what most struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the womans greyish face
424	back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again still rubbing his neck
425	the music from the telescreen had stopped
426	instead a clipped military voice was reading out with a sort of brutal relish a description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland and the faroe islands
427	with those children he thought that wretched woman must lead a life of terror
428	another year two years and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy
429	nearly all children nowadays were horrible
430	what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party
431	on the contrary they adored the party and everything connected with it
432	the songs the processions the banners the hiking the drilling with dummy rifles the yelling of slogans the worship of big brotherit was all a sort of glorious game to them
433	all their ferocity was turned outwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners traitors saboteurs thoughtcriminals
434	it was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children
435	and with good reason for hardly a week passed in which the times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneakchild hero was the phrase generally usedhad overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the thought police
436	the sting of the catapult bullet had worn off
437	he picked up his pen halfheartedly wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary
438	suddenly he began thinking of obrien again
439	years agohow long was it
440	seven years it must behe had dreamed that he was walking through a pitchdark room
441	and someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness
442	it was said very quietly almost casuallya statement not a command
443	he had walked on without pausing
444	what was curious was that at the time in the dream the words had not made much impression on him
445	it was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance
446	he could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen obrien for the first time nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as obriens
447	but at any rate the identification existed
448	it was obrien who had spoken to him out of the dark
449	winston had never been able to feel sureeven after this mornings flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether obrien was a friend or an enemy
450	nor did it even seem to matter greatly
451	there was a link of understanding between them more important than affection or partisanship
452	we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness he had said
453	winston did not know what it meant only that in some way or another it would come true
454	the voice from the telescreen paused
455	a trumpet call clear and beautiful floated into the stagnant air
456	the voice continued raspingly
457	attention
458	your attention please
459	a newsflash has this moment arrived from the malabar front
460	our forces in south india have won a glorious victory
461	i am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end
462	here is the newsflash
463	bad news coming thought winston
464	and sure enough following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners came the announcement that as from next week the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty
465	winston belched again
466	the gin was wearing off leaving a deflated feeling
467	the telescreenperhaps to celebrate the victory perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolatecrashed into oceania tis for thee
468	you were supposed to stand to attention
469	however in his present position he was invisible
470	oceania tis for thee gave way to lighter music
471	winston walked over to the window keeping his back to the telescreen
472	the day was still cold and clear
473	somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull reverberating roar
474	about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present
475	down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro and the word ingsoc fitfully appeared and vanished
476	ingsoc
477	the sacred principles of ingsoc
478	newspeak doublethink the mutability of the past
479	he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster
480	he was alone
481	the past was dead the future was unimaginable
482	what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side
483	and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure for ever
484	like an answer the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to him
485	war is peace
486	freedom is slavery
487	ignorance is strength
488	he took a twentyfive cent piece out of his pocket
489	there too in tiny clear lettering the same slogans were inscribed and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother
490	even from the coin the eyes pursued you
491	on coins on stamps on the covers of books on banners on posters and on the wrappings of a cigarette packeteverywhere
492	always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you
493	asleep or awake working or eating indoors or out of doors in the bath or in bedno escape
494	nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull
495	the sun had shifted round and the myriad windows of the ministry of truth with the light no longer shining on them looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress
496	his heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape
497	it was too strong it could not be stormed
498	a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down
499	he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary
500	for the future for the pastfor an age that might be imaginary
501	and in front of him there lay not death but annihilation
502	the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour
503	only the thought police would read what he had written before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory
504	how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper could physically survive
505	the telescreen struck fourteen
506	he must leave in ten minutes
507	he had to be back at work by fourteenthirty
508	curiously the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him
509	he was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear
510	but so long as he uttered it in some obscure way the continuity was not broken
511	it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage
512	he went back to the table dipped his pen and wrote
513	to the future or to the past to a time when thought is free when men are different from one another and do not live aloneto a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone
514	from the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of big brother from the age of doublethinkgreetings
515	he was already dead he reflected
516	it seemed to him that it was only now when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts that he had taken the decisive step
517	the consequences of every act are included in the act itself
518	he wrote
519	thoughtcrime does not entail death thoughtcrime is death
520	now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible
521	two fingers of his right hand were inkstained
522	it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you
523	some nosing zealot in the ministry a woman probably someone like the little sandyhaired woman or the darkhaired girl from the fiction department might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval why he had used an oldfashioned pen what he had been writingand then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter
524	he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose
525	he put the diary away in the drawer
526	it was quite useless to think of hiding it but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered
527	a hair laid across the pageends was too obvious
528	with the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved
529	chapter
530	winston was dreaming of his mother
531	he must he thought have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared
532	she was a tall statuesque rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair
533	his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin dressed always in neat dark clothes winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his fathers shoes and wearing spectacles
534	the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties
535	at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him with his young sister in her arms
536	he did not remember his sister at all except as a tiny feeble baby always silent with large watchful eyes
537	both of them were looking up at him
538	they were down in some subterranean placethe bottom of a well for instance or a very deep gravebut it was a place which already far below him was itself moving downwards
539	they were in the saloon of a sinking ship looking up at him through the darkening water
540	there was still air in the saloon they could still see him and he them but all the while they were sinking down down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever
541	he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death and they were down there because he was up here
542	he knew it and they knew it and he could see the knowledge in their faces
543	there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things
544	he could not remember what had happened but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own
545	it was one of those dreams which while retaining the characteristic dream scenery are a continuation of ones intellectual life and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake
546	the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his mothers death nearly thirty years ago had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible
547	tragedy he perceived belonged to the ancient time to a time when there was still privacy love and friendship and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason
548	his mothers memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him when he was too young and selfish to love her in return and because somehow he did not remember how she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable
549	such things he saw could not happen today
550	today there were fear hatred and pain but no dignity of emotion no deep or complex sorrows
551	all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister looking up at him through the green water hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking
552	suddenly he was standing on short springy turf on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground
553	the landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world
554	in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country
555	it was an old rabbitbitten pasture with a foottrack wandering across it and a molehill here and there
556	in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze their leaves just stirring in dense masses like womens hair
557	somewhere near at hand though out of sight there was a clear slowmoving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees
558	the girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field
559	with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside
560	her body was white and smooth but it aroused no desire in him indeed he barely looked at it
561	what overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside
562	with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture a whole system of thought as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm
563	that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time
564	winston woke up with the word shakespeare on his lips
565	the telescreen was giving forth an earsplitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds
566	it was nought seven fifteen gettingup time for office workers
567	winston wrenched his body out of bednaked for a member of the outer party received only clothing coupons annually and a suit of pyjamas was and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair
568	the physical jerks would begin in three minutes
569	the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up
570	it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps
571	his veins had swelled with the effort of the cough and the varicose ulcer had started itching
572	thirty to forty group
573	yapped a piercing female voice
574	thirty to forty group
575	take your places please
576	thirties to forties
577	winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen upon which the image of a youngish woman scrawny but muscular dressed in tunic and gymshoes had already appeared
578	arms bending and stretching
579	she rapped out
580	take your time by me
581	one two three four
582	one two three four
583	come on comrades put a bit of life into it
584	one two three four
585	one two three four
586	the pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winstons mind the impression made by his dream and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat
587	as he mechanically shot his arms back and forth wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood
588	it was extraordinarily difficult
589	beyond the late fifties everything faded
590	when there were no external records that you could refer to even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness
591	you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing
592	everything had been different then
593	even the names of countries and their shapes on the map had been different
594	airstrip one for instance had not been so called in those days it had been called england or britain though london he felt fairly certain had always been called london
595	winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise
596	perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester
597	he did not remember the raid itself but he did remember his fathers hand clutching his own as they hurried down down down into some place deep in the earth round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest
598	his mother in her slow dreamy way was following a long way behind them
599	she was carrying his baby sisteror perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying he was not certain whether his sister had been born then
600	finally they had emerged into a noisy crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station
601	there were people sitting all over the stoneflagged floor and other people packed tightly together were sitting on metal bunks one above the other
602	winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk
603	the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears
604	he reeked of gin
605	it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin
606	but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable
607	in his childish way winston grasped that some terrible thing something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied had just happened
608	it also seemed to him that he knew what it was
609	someone whom the old man loveda little granddaughter perhapshad been killed
610	every few minutes the old man kept repeating
611	we didnt ought to ave trusted em
612	i said so ma didnt i
613	thats what comes of trusting em
614	i said so all along
615	we didnt ought to ave trusted the buggers
616	but which buggers they didnt ought to have trusted winston could not now remember
617	since about that time war had been literally continuous though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war
618	for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself some of which he remembered vividly
619	but to trace out the history of the whole period to say who was fighting whom at any given moment would have been utterly impossible since no written record and no spoken word ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one
620	at this moment for example in if it was oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia
621	in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines
622	actually as winston well knew it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia
623	but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control
624	officially the change of partners had never happened
625	oceania was at war with eurasia therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia
626	the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible
627	the frightening thing he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward with hands on hips they were gyrating their bodies from the waist an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back musclesthe frightening thing was that it might all be true
628	if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event it never happenedthat surely was more terrifying than mere torture and death
629	the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia
630	he winston smith knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago
631	but where did that knowledge exist
632	only in his own consciousness which in any case must soon be annihilated
633	and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposedif all records told the same talethen the lie passed into history and became truth
634	who controls the past ran the party slogan controls the future who controls the present controls the past
635	and yet the past though of its nature alterable never had been altered
636	whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting
637	it was quite simple
638	all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory
639	reality control they called it in newspeak doublethink
640	stand easy
641	barked the instructress a little more genially
642	winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air
643	his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink
644	to know and not to know to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy to forget whatever it was necessary to forget then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed and then promptly to forget it again and above all to apply the same process to the process itself
645	that was the ultimate subtlety consciously to induce unconsciousness and then once again to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed
646	even to understand the word doublethink involved the use of doublethink
647	the instructress had called them to attention again
648	and now lets see which of us can touch our toes
649	she said enthusiastically
650	right over from the hips please comrades
651	onetwo
652	onetwo
653	winston loathed this exercise which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit
654	the halfpleasant quality went out of his meditations
655	the past he reflected had not merely been altered it had been actually destroyed
656	for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory
657	he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother
658	he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties but it was impossible to be certain
659	in the party histories of course big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days
660	his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motorcars or horse carriages with glass sides
661	there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented
662	winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence
663	he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before but it was possible that in its oldspeak formenglish socialism that is to sayit had been current earlier
664	everything melted into mist
665	sometimes indeed you could put your finger on a definite lie
666	it was not true for example as was claimed in the party history books that the party had invented aeroplanes
667	he remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood
668	but you could prove nothing
669	there was never any evidence
670	just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact
671	and on that occasion
672	smith
673	screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen
674	smith w
675	yes you
676	bend lower please
677	you can do better than that
678	youre not trying
679	lower please
680	thats better comrade
681	now stand at ease the whole squad and watch me
682	a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winstons body
683	his face remained completely inscrutable
684	never show dismay
685	never show resentment
686	a single flicker of the eyes could give you away
687	he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head andone could not say gracefully but with remarkable neatness and efficiencybent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes
688	there comrades
689	thats how i want to see you doing it
690	watch me again
691	im thirtynine and ive had four children
692	now look
693	she bent over again
694	you see my knees arent bent
695	you can all do it if you want to she added as she straightened herself up
696	anyone under fortyfive is perfectly capable of touching his toes
697	we dont all have the privilege of fighting in the front line but at least we can all keep fit
698	remember our boys on the malabar front
699	and the sailors in the floating fortresses
700	just think what they have to put up with
701	now try again
702	thats better comrade thats much better she added encouragingly as winston with a violent lunge succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent for the first time in several years
703	chapter
704	with the deep unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his days work started winston pulled the speakwrite towards him blew the dust from its mouthpiece and put on his spectacles
705	then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the righthand side of his desk
706	in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices
707	to the right of the speakwrite a small pneumatic tube for written messages to the left a larger one for newspapers and in the side wall within easy reach of winstons arm a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating
708	this last was for the disposal of waste paper
709	similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor
710	for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes
711	when one knew that any document was due for destruction or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building
712	winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled
713	each contained a message of only one or two lines in the abbreviated jargonnot actually newspeak but consisting largely of newspeak wordswhich was used in the ministry for internal purposes
714	they ran
715	times bb speech malreported africa rectify
716	times forecasts yp th quarter misprints verify current issue
717	times miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify
718	times reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
719	with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside
720	it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last
721	the other three were routine matters though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures
722	winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the times which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delay
723	the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter or as the official phrase had it to rectify
724	for example it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that big brother in his speech of the previous day had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa
725	as it happened the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone
726	it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brothers speech in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened
727	or again the times of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth threeyear plan
728	todays issue contained a statement of the actual output from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong
729	winstons job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones
730	as for the third message it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes
731	as short a time ago as february the ministry of plenty had issued a promise a categorical pledge were the official words that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during
732	actually as winston was aware the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week
733	all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april
734	as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube
735	then with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames
736	what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led he did not know in detail but he did know in general terms
737	as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the times had been assembled and collated that number would be reprinted the original copy destroyed and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead
738	this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers but to books periodicals pamphlets posters leaflets films soundtracks cartoons photographsto every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance
739	day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date
740	in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct nor was any item of news or any expression of opinion which conflicted with the needs of the moment ever allowed to remain on record
741	all history was a palimpsest scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary
742	in no case would it have been possible once the deed was done to prove that any falsification had taken place
743	the largest section of the records department far larger than the one on which winston worked consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books newspapers and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction
744	a number of the times which might because of changes in political alignment or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date and no other copy existed to contradict it
745	books also were recalled and rewritten again and again and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made
746	even the written instructions which winston received and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed always the reference was to slips errors misprints or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy
747	but actually he thought as he readjusted the ministry of plentys figures it was not even forgery
748	it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another
749	most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie
750	statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version
751	a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head
752	for example the ministry of plentys forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at million pairs
753	the actual output was given as sixtytwo millions
754	winston however in rewriting the forecast marked the figure down to fiftyseven millions so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled
755	in any case sixtytwo millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions or than millions
756	very likely no boots had been produced at all
757	likelier still nobody knew how many had been produced much less cared
758	all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot
759	and so it was with every class of recorded fact great or small
760	everything faded away into a shadowworld in which finally even the date of the year had become uncertain
761	winston glanced across the hall
762	in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small preciselooking darkchinned man named tillotson was working steadily away with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite
763	he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen
764	he looked up and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winstons direction
765	winston hardly knew tillotson and had no idea what work he was employed on
766	people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs
767	in the long windowless hall with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate
768	he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed
769	there was a certain fitness in this since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier
770	and a few cubicles away a mild ineffectual dreamy creature named ampleforth with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres was engaged in producing garbled versionsdefinitive texts they were calledof poems which had become ideologically offensive but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies
771	and this hall with its fifty workers or thereabouts was only one subsection a single cell as it were in the huge complexity of the records department
772	beyond above below were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs
773	there were the huge printingshops with their subeditors their typography experts and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs
774	there was the teleprogrammes section with its engineers its producers and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices
775	there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall
776	there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed
777	and somewhere or other quite anonymous there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved that one falsified and the other rubbed out of existence
778	and the records department after all was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers films textbooks telescreen programmes plays novelswith every conceivable kind of information instruction or entertainment from a statue to a slogan from a lyric poem to a biological treatise and from a childs spellingbook to a newspeak dictionary
779	and the ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat
780	there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature music drama and entertainment generally
781	here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport crime and astrology sensational fivecent novelettes films oozing with sex and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator
782	there was even a whole subsectionpornosec it was called in newspeakengaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member other than those who worked on it was permitted to look at
783	three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working but they were simple matters and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him
784	when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf pushed the speakwrite to one side cleaned his spectacles and settled down to his main job of the morning
785	winstons greatest pleasure in life was in his work
786	most of it was a tedious routine but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problemdelicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say
787	winston was good at this kind of thing
788	on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles which were written entirely in newspeak
789	he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier
790	it ran
791	times reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
792	in oldspeak or standard english this might be rendered
793	the reporting of big brothers order for the day in the times of december rd is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to nonexistent persons
794	rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing
795	winston read through the offending article
796	big brothers order for the day it seemed had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses
797	a certain comrade withers a prominent member of the inner party had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration the order of conspicuous merit second class
798	three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given
799	one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen
800	that was to be expected since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced
801	the great purges involving thousands of people with public trials of traitors and thoughtcriminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed were special showpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years
802	more commonly people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again
803	one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them
804	in some cases they might not even be dead
805	perhaps thirty people personally known to winston not counting his parents had disappeared at one time or another
806	winston stroked his nose gently with a paperclip
807	in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite
808	he raised his head for a moment again the hostile spectacleflash
809	winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself
810	it was perfectly possible
811	so tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person on the other hand to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place
812	very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said
813	and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that would reedit it and set in motion the complex processes of crossreferencing that would be required and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth
814	winston did not know why withers had been disgraced
815	perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence
816	perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a toopopular subordinate
817	perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies
818	or perhapswhat was likeliest of allthe thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government
819	the only real clue lay in the words refs unpersons which indicated that withers was already dead
820	you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested
821	sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed
822	very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing this time for ever
823	withers however was already an unperson
824	he did not exist he had never existed
825	winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brothers speech
826	it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject
827	he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thoughtcriminals but that was a little too obvious while to invent a victory at the front or some triumph of overproduction in the ninth threeyear plan might complicate the records too much
828	what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy
829	suddenly there sprang into his mind ready made as it were the image of a certain comrade ogilvy who had recently died in battle in heroic circumstances
830	there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble rankandfile party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed
831	today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy
832	it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence
833	winston thought for a moment then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in big brothers familiar style a style at once military and pedantic and because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them what lessons do we learn from this fact comrades
834	the lessonwhich is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsocthat etc etc
835	easy to imitate
836	at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum a submachine gun and a model helicopter
837	at sixa year early by a special relaxation of the ruleshe had joined the spies at nine he had been a troop leader
838	at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies
839	at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior antisex league
840	at nineteen he had designed a handgrenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which at its first trial had killed thirtyone eurasian prisoners in one burst
841	at twentythree he had perished in action
842	pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water despatches and allan end said big brother which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy
843	big brother added a few remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of comrade ogilvys life
844	he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium and had taken a vow of celibacy believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twentyfourhouraday devotion to duty
845	he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the huntingdown of spies saboteurs thoughtcriminals and traitors generally
846	winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary crossreferencing that it would entail
847	once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle
848	something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself
849	there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own
850	comrade ogilvy unimagined an hour ago was now a fact
851	it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones
852	comrade ogilvy who had never existed in the present now existed in the past and when once the act of forgery was forgotten he would exist just as authentically and upon the same evidence as charlemagne or julius caesar
853	chapter
854	in the lowceilinged canteen deep underground the lunch queue jerked slowly forward
855	the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy
856	from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin
857	on the far side of the room there was a small bar a mere hole in the wall where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip
858	just the man i was looking for said a voice at winstons back
859	he turned round
860	it was his friend syme who worked in the research department
861	perhaps friend was not exactly the right word
862	you did not have friends nowadays you had comrades but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others
863	syme was a philologist a specialist in newspeak
864	indeed he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
865	he was a tiny creature smaller than winston with dark hair and large protuberant eyes at once mournful and derisive which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you
866	i wanted to ask you whether youd got any razor blades he said
867	not one
868	said winston with a sort of guilty haste
869	ive tried all over the place
870	they dont exist any longer
871	everyone kept asking you for razor blades
872	actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up
873	there had been a famine of them for months past
874	at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply
875	sometimes it was buttons sometimes it was darning wool sometimes it was shoelaces at present it was razor blades
876	you could only get hold of them if at all by scrounging more or less furtively on the free market
877	ive been using the same blade for six weeks he added untruthfully
878	the queue gave another jerk forward
879	as they halted he turned and faced syme again
880	each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter
881	did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday
882	said syme
883	i was working said winston indifferently
884	i shall see it on the flicks i suppose
885	a very inadequate substitute said syme
886	his mocking eyes roved over winstons face
887	i know you the eyes seemed to say i see through you
888	i know very well why you didnt go to see those prisoners hanged
889	in an intellectual way syme was venomously orthodox
890	he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages and trials and confessions of thoughtcriminals the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love
891	talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him if possible in the technicalities of newspeak on which he was authoritative and interesting
892	winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes
893	it was a good hanging said syme reminiscently
894	i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together
895	i like to see them kicking
896	and above all at the end the tongue sticking right out and bluea quite bright blue
897	thats the detail that appeals to me
898	nex please
899	yelled the whiteaproned prole with the ladle
900	winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille
901	on to each was dumped swiftly the regulation luncha metal pannikin of pinkishgrey stew a hunk of bread a cube of cheese a mug of milkless victory coffee and one saccharine tablet
902	theres a table over there under that telescreen said syme
903	lets pick up a gin on the way
904	the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs
905	they threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metaltopped table on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit
906	winston took up his mug of gin paused for an instant to collect his nerve and gulped the oilytasting stuff down
907	when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry
908	he began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew which in among its general sloppiness had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat
909	neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins
910	from the table at winstons left a little behind his back someone was talking rapidly and continuously a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck which pierced the general uproar of the room
911	how is the dictionary getting on
912	said winston raising his voice to overcome the noise
913	slowly said syme
914	im on the adjectives
915	its fascinating
916	he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak
917	he pushed his pannikin aside took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting
918	the eleventh edition is the definitive edition he said
919	were getting the language into its final shapethe shape its going to have when nobody speaks anything else
920	when weve finished with it people like you will have to learn it all over again
921	you think i dare say that our chief job is inventing new words
922	but not a bit of it
923	were destroying wordsscores of them hundreds of them every day
924	were cutting the language down to the bone
925	the eleventh edition wont contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year
926	he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls then continued speaking with a sort of pedants passion
927	his thin dark face had become animated his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy
928	its a beautiful thing the destruction of words
929	of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well
930	it isnt only the synonyms there are also the antonyms
931	after all what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word
932	a word contains its opposite in itself
933	take good for instance
934	if you have a word like good what need is there for a word like bad
935	ungood will do just as wellbetter because its an exact opposite which the other is not
936	or again if you want a stronger version of good what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them
937	plusgood covers the meaning or doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still
938	of course we use those forms already
939	but in the final version of newspeak therell be nothing else
940	in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six wordsin reality only one word
941	dont you see the beauty of that winston
942	it was bb
943	s idea originally of course he added as an afterthought
944	a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winstons face at the mention of big brother
945	nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm
946	you havent a real appreciation of newspeak winston he said almost sadly
947	even when you write it youre still thinking in oldspeak
948	ive read some of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally
949	theyre good enough but theyre translations
950	in your heart youd prefer to stick to oldspeak with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning
951	you dont grasp the beauty of the destruction of words
952	do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year
953	winston did know that of course
954	he smiled sympathetically he hoped not trusting himself to speak
955	syme bit off another fragment of the darkcoloured bread chewed it briefly and went on
956	dont you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought
957	in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it
958	every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten
959	already in the eleventh edition were not far from that point
960	but the process will still be continuing long after you and i are dead
961	every year fewer and fewer words and the range of consciousness always a little smaller
962	even now of course theres no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime
963	its merely a question of selfdiscipline realitycontrol
964	but in the end there wont be any need even for that
965	the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect
966	newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is newspeak he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction
967	has it ever occurred to you winston that by the year at the very latest not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now
968	except began winston doubtfully and he stopped
969	it had been on the tip of his tongue to say except the proles but he checked himself not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox
970	syme however had divined what he was about to say
971	the proles are not human beings he said carelessly
972	by earlier probablyall real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared
973	the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed
974	chaucer shakespeare milton byrontheyll exist only in newspeak versions not merely changed into something different but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be
975	even the literature of the party will change
976	even the slogans will change
977	how could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished
978	the whole climate of thought will be different
979	in fact there will be no thought as we understand it now
980	orthodoxy means not thinkingnot needing to think
981	orthodoxy is unconsciousness
982	one of these days thought winston with sudden deep conviction syme will be vaporized
983	he is too intelligent
984	he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly
985	the party does not like such people
986	one day he will disappear
987	it is written in his face
988	winston had finished his bread and cheese
989	he turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee
990	at the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away
991	a young woman who was perhaps his secretary and who was sitting with her back to winston was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said
992	from time to time winston caught some such remark as i think youre so right i do so agree with you uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice
993	but the other voice never stopped for an instant even when the girl was speaking
994	winston knew the man by sight though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department
995	he was a man of about thirty with a muscular throat and a large mobile mouth
996	his head was thrown back a little and because of the angle at which he was sitting his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes
997	what was slightly horrible was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word
998	just once winston caught a phrasecomplete and final elimination of goldsteinismjerked out very rapidly and as it seemed all in one piece like a line of type cast solid
999	for the rest it was just a noise a quackquackquacking
1000	and yet though you could not actually hear what the man was saying you could not be in any doubt about its general nature
1001	he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thoughtcriminals and saboteurs he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army he might be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabar frontit made no difference
1002	whatever it was you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy pure ingsoc
1003	as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy
1004	it was not the mans brain that was speaking it was his larynx
1005	the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words but it was not speech in the true sense it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness like the quacking of a duck
1006	syme had fallen silent for a moment and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew
1007	the voice from the other table quacked rapidly on easily audible in spite of the surrounding din
1008	there is a word in newspeak said syme i dont know whether you know it duckspeak to quack like a duck
1009	it is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings
1010	applied to an opponent it is abuse applied to someone you agree with it is praise
1011	unquestionably syme will be vaporized winston thought again
1012	he thought it with a kind of sadness although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thoughtcriminal if he saw any reason for doing so
1013	there was something subtly wrong with syme
1014	there was something that he lacked discretion aloofness a sort of saving stupidity
1015	you could not say that he was unorthodox
1016	he believed in the principles of ingsoc he venerated big brother he rejoiced over victories he hated heretics not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal an uptodateness of information which the ordinary party member did not approach
1017	yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him
1018	he said things that would have been better unsaid he had read too many books he frequented the chestnut tree cafe haunt of painters and musicians
1019	there was no law not even an unwritten law against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe yet the place was somehow illomened
1020	the old discredited leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged
1021	goldstein himself it was said had sometimes been seen there years and decades ago
1022	symes fate was not difficult to foresee
1023	and yet it was a fact that if syme grasped even for three seconds the nature of his winstons secret opinions he would betray him instantly to the thought police
1024	so would anybody else for that matter but syme more than most
1025	zeal was not enough
1026	orthodoxy was unconsciousness
1027	syme looked up
1028	here comes parsons he said
1029	something in the tone of his voice seemed to add that bloody fool
1030	parsons winstons fellowtenant at victory mansions was in fact threading his way across the rooma tubby middlesized man with fair hair and a froglike face
1031	at thirtyfive he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline but his movements were brisk and boyish
1032	his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts grey shirt and red neckerchief of the spies
1033	in visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms
1034	parsons did indeed invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so
1035	he greeted them both with a cheery hullo hullo
1036	and sat down at the table giving off an intense smell of sweat
1037	beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face
1038	his powers of sweating were extraordinary
1039	at the community centre you could always tell when he had been playing tabletennis by the dampness of the bat handle
1040	syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words and was studying it with an inkpencil between his fingers
1041	look at him working away in the lunch hour said parsons nudging winston
1042	keenness eh
1043	whats that youve got there old boy
1044	something a bit too brainy for me i expect
1045	smith old boy ill tell you why im chasing you
1046	its that sub you forgot to give me
1047	which sub is that
1048	said winston automatically feeling for money
1049	about a quarter of ones salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them
1050	for hate week
1051	you knowthe housebyhouse fund
1052	im treasurer for our block
1053	were making an allout effortgoing to put on a tremendous show
1054	i tell you it wont be my fault if old victory mansions doesnt have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street
1055	two dollars you promised me
1056	winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes which parsons entered in a small notebook in the neat handwriting of the illiterate
1057	by the way old boy he said
1058	i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday
1059	i gave him a good dressingdown for it
1060	in fact i told him id take the catapult away if he does it again
1061	i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution said winston
1062	ah wellwhat i mean to say shows the right spirit doesnt it
1063	mischievous little beggars they are both of them but talk about keenness
1064	all they think about is the spies and the war of course
1065	dyou know what that little girl of mine did last saturday when her troop was on a hike out berkhamsted way
1066	she got two other girls to go with her slipped off from the hike and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man
1067	they kept on his tail for two hours right through the woods and then when they got into amersham handed him over to the patrols
1068	what did they do that for
1069	said winston somewhat taken aback
1070	parsons went on triumphantly
1071	my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agentmight have been dropped by parachute for instance
1072	but heres the point old boy
1073	what do you think put her on to him in the first place
1074	she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoessaid shed never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before
1075	so the chances were he was a foreigner
1076	pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh
1077	what happened to the man
1078	said winston
1079	ah that i couldnt say of course
1080	but i wouldnt be altogether surprised if parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle and clicked his tongue for the explosion
1081	good said syme abstractedly without looking up from his strip of paper
1082	of course we cant afford to take chances agreed winston dutifully
1083	what i mean to say there is a war on said parsons
1084	as though in confirmation of this a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads
1085	however it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty
1086	comrades
1087	cried an eager youthful voice
1088	attention comrades
1089	we have glorious news for you
1090	we have won the battle for production
1091	returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than per cent over the past year
1092	all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us
1093	here are some of the completed figures
1094	foodstuffs
1095	the phrase our new happy life recurred several times
1096	it had been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty
1097	parsons his attention caught by the trumpet call sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity a sort of edified boredom
1098	he could not follow the figures but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction
1099	he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco
1100	with the tobacco ration at grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top
1101	winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal
1102	the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left
1103	for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen
1104	it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week
1105	and only yesterday he reflected it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week
1106	was it possible that they could swallow that after only twentyfour hours
1107	yes they swallowed it
1108	parsons swallowed it easily with the stupidity of an animal
1109	the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically passionately with a furious desire to track down denounce and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes
1110	syme tooin some more complex way involving doublethink syme swallowed it
1111	was he then alone in the possession of a memory
1112	the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen
1113	as compared with last year there was more food more clothes more houses more furniture more cookingpots more fuel more ships more helicopters more books more babiesmore of everything except disease crime and insanity
1114	year by year and minute by minute everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards
1115	as syme had done earlier winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the palecoloured gravy that dribbled across the table drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern
1116	he meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life
1117	had it always been like this
1118	had food always tasted like this
1119	he looked round the canteen
1120	a lowceilinged crowded room its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies battered metal tables and chairs placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching bent spoons dented trays coarse white mugs all surfaces greasy grime in every crack and a sourish composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes
1121	always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to
1122	it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different
1123	in any time that he could accurately remember there had never been quite enough to eat one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes furniture had always been battered and rickety rooms underheated tube trains crowded houses falling to pieces bread darkcoloured tea a rarity coffee filthytasting cigarettes insufficientnothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin
1124	and though of course it grew worse as ones body aged was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things if ones heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity the interminable winters the stickiness of ones socks the lifts that never worked the cold water the gritty soap the cigarettes that came to pieces the food with its strange evil tastes
1125	why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different
1126	he looked round the canteen again
1127	nearly everyone was ugly and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls
1128	on the far side of the room sitting at a table alone a small curiously beetlelike man was drinking a cup of coffee his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side
1129	how easy it was thought winston if you did not look about you to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an idealtall muscular youths and deepbosomed maidens blondhaired vital sunburnt carefreeexisted and even predominated
1130	actually so far as he could judge the majority of people in airstrip one were small dark and illfavoured
1131	it was curious how that beetlelike type proliferated in the ministries little dumpy men growing stout very early in life with short legs swift scuttling movements and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes
1132	it was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party
1133	the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music
1134	parsons stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures took his pipe out of his mouth
1135	the ministry of plentys certainly done a good job this year he said with a knowing shake of his head
1136	by the way smith old boy i suppose you havent got any razor blades you can let me have
1137	not one said winston
1138	ive been using the same blade for six weeks myself
1139	ah welljust thought id ask you old boy
1140	sorry said winston
1141	the quacking voice from the next table temporarily silenced during the ministrys announcement had started up again as loud as ever
1142	for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face
1143	within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police
1144	mrs parsons would be vaporized
1145	syme would be vaporized
1146	winston would be vaporized
1147	obrien would be vaporized
1148	parsons on the other hand would never be vaporized
1149	the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized
1150	the little beetlelike men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries they too would never be vaporized
1151	and the girl with dark hair the girl from the fiction departmentshe would never be vaporized either
1152	it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish though just what it was that made for survival it was not easy to say
1153	at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk
1154	the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him
1155	it was the girl with dark hair
1156	she was looking at him in a sidelong way but with curious intensity
1157	the instant she caught his eye she looked away again
1158	the sweat started out on winstons backbone
1159	a horrible pang of terror went through him
1160	it was gone almost at once but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind
1161	why was she watching him
1162	why did she keep following him about
1163	unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived or had come there afterwards
1164	but yesterday at any rate during the two minutes hate she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so
1165	quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough
1166	his earlier thought returned to him probably she was not actually a member of the thought police but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all
1167	he did not know how long she had been looking at him but perhaps for as much as five minutes and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control
1168	it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen
1169	the smallest thing could give you away
1170	a nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering to yourselfanything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality of having something to hide
1171	in any case to wear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example was itself a punishable offence
1172	there was even a word for it in newspeak facecrime it was called
1173	the girl had turned her back on him again
1174	perhaps after all she was not really following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running
1175	his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table
1176	he would finish smoking it after work if he could keep the tobacco in it
1177	quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette end must not be wasted
1178	syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket
1179	parsons had begun talking again
1180	did i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of his pipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old marketwomans skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of bb
1181	sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches
1182	burned her quite badly i believe
1183	little beggars eh
1184	but keen as mustard
1185	thats a firstrate training they give them in the spies nowadaysbetter than in my day even
1186	what dyou thinks the latest thing theyve served them out with
1187	ear trumpets for listening through keyholes
1188	my little girl brought one home the other nighttried it out on our sittingroom door and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole
1189	of course its only a toy mind you
1190	still gives em the right idea eh
1191	at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle
1192	it was the signal to return to work
1193	all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winstons cigarette
1194	chapter
1195	winston was writing in his diary
1196	it was three years ago
1197	it was on a dark evening in a narrow sidestreet near one of the big railway stations
1198	she was standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly gave any light
1199	she had a young face painted very thick
1200	it was really the paint that appealed to me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips
1201	party women never paint their faces
1202	there was nobody else in the street and no telescreens
1203	she said two dollars
1204	i
1205	for the moment it was too difficult to go on
1206	he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring
1207	he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice
1208	or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the windowto do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him
1209	your worst enemy he reflected was your own nervous system
1210	at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom
1211	he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back a quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirtyfive to forty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase
1212	they were a few metres apart when the left side of the mans face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm
1213	it happened again just as they were passing one another it was only a twitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter but obviously habitual
1214	he remembered thinking at the time that poor devil is done for
1215	and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious
1216	the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep
1217	there was no way of guarding against that so far as he could see
1218	he drew his breath and went on writing
1219	i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen
1220	there was a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turned down very low
1221	she
1222	his teeth were set on edge
1223	he would have liked to spit
1224	simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine his wife
1225	winston was marriedhad been married at any rate probably he still was married so far as he knew his wife was not dead
1226	he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so
1227	only the proles used scent
1228	in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication
1229	when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts
1230	consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break
1231	it was dangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter
1232	to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had committed no other offence
1233	and it was easy enough provided that you could avoid being caught in the act
1234	the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves
1235	some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles were not supposed to drink
1236	tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed
1237	mere debauchery did not matter very much so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class
1238	the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members
1239	butthough this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed toit was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening
1240	the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control
1241	its real undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act
1242	not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it
1243	all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose andthough the principle was never clearly statedpermission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another
1244	the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party
1245	sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema
1246	this again was never put into plain words but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards
1247	there were even organizations such as the junior antisex league which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes
1248	all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions
1249	this winston was aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party
1250	the party was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not be killed then to distort it and dirty it
1251	he did not know why this was so but it seemed natural that it should be so
1252	and as far as the women were concerned the partys efforts were largely successful
1253	he thought again of katharine
1254	it must be nine tennearly eleven years since they had parted
1255	it was curious how seldom he thought of her
1256	for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married
1257	they had only been together for about fifteen months
1258	the party did not permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children
1259	katharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight with splendid movements
1260	she had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it
1261	very early in her married life he had decidedthough perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most peoplethat she had without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered
1262	she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan and there was no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her
1263	the human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind
1264	yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thingsex
1265	as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen
1266	to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image
1267	and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength
1268	the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression
1269	she would lie there with shut eyes neither resisting nor cooperating but submitting
1270	it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible
1271	but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate
1272	but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this
1273	they must she said produce a child if they could
1274	so the performance continued to happen once a week quite regularly whenever it was not impossible
1275	she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten
1276	she had two names for it
1277	one was making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase
1278	quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round
1279	but luckily no child appeared and in the end she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards they parted
1280	winston sighed inaudibly
1281	he picked up his pen again and wrote
1282	she threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled up her skirt
1283	i
1284	he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the party
1285	why did it always have to be like this
1286	why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years
1287	but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event
1288	the women of the party were all alike
1289	chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty
1290	by careful early conditioning by games and cold water by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league by lectures parades songs slogans and martial music the natural feeling had been driven out of them
1291	his reason told him that there must be exceptions but his heart did not believe it
1292	they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be
1293	and what he wanted more even than to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his whole life
1294	the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion
1295	desire was thoughtcrime
1296	even to have awakened katharine if he could have achieved it would have been like a seduction although she was his wife
1297	but the rest of the story had got to be written down
1298	he wrote
1299	i turned up the lamp
1300	when i saw her in the light
1301	after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright
1302	for the first time he could see the woman properly
1303	he had taken a step towards her and then halted full of lust and terror
1304	he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here
1305	it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment
1306	if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do
1307	it had got to be written down it had got to be confessed
1308	what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old
1309	the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask
1310	there were streaks of white in her hair but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness
1311	she had no teeth at all
1312	he wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting
1313	when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fifty years old at least
1314	but i went ahead and did it just the same
1315	he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again
1316	he had written it down at last but it made no difference
1317	the therapy had not worked
1318	the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever
1319	chapter
1320	if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the proles
1321	if there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those swarming disregarded masses per cent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated
1322	the party could not be overthrown from within
1323	its enemies if it had any enemies had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another
1324	even if the legendary brotherhood existed as just possibly it might it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes
1325	rebellion meant a look in the eyes an inflexion of the voice at the most an occasional whispered word
1326	but the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength
1327	would have no need to conspire
1328	they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies
1329	if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning
1330	surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it
1331	and yet
1332	he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices womens voiceshad burst from a sidestreet a little way ahead
1333	it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud ohooooh
1334	that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell
1335	his heart had leapt
1336	its started
1337	he had thought
1338	a riot
1339	the proles are breaking loose at last
1340	when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship
1341	but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels
1342	it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans
1343	they were wretched flimsy things but cookingpots of any kind were always difficult to get
1344	now the supply had unexpectedly given out
1345	the successful women bumped and jostled by the rest were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve
1346	there was a fresh outburst of yells
1347	two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one anothers hands
1348	for a moment they were both tugging and then the handle came off
1349	winston watched them disgustedly
1350	and yet just for a moment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats
1351	why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered
1352	he wrote
1353	until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious
1354	that he reflected might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks
1355	the party claimed of course to have liberated the proles from bondage
1356	before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists they had been starved and flogged women had been forced to work in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines as a matter of fact children had been sold into the factories at the age of six
1357	but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection like animals by the application of a few simple rules
1358	in reality very little was known about the proles
1359	it was not necessary to know much
1360	so long as they continued to work and breed their other activities were without importance
1361	left to themselves like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern
1362	they were born they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passed through a brief blossomingperiod of beauty and sexual desire they married at twenty they were middleaged at thirty they died for the most part at sixty
1363	heavy physical work the care of home and children petty quarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gambling filled up the horizon of their minds
1364	to keep them in control was not difficult
1365	a few agents of the thought police moved always among them spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party
1366	it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings
1367	all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer workinghours or shorter rations
1368	and even when they became discontented as they sometimes did their discontent led nowhere because being without general ideas they could only focus it on petty specific grievances
1369	the larger evils invariably escaped their notice
1370	the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes
1371	even the civil police interfered with them very little
1372	there was a vast amount of criminality in london a whole worldwithinaworld of thieves bandits prostitutes drugpeddlers and racketeers of every description but since it all happened among the proles themselves it was of no importance
1373	in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code
1374	the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them
1375	promiscuity went unpunished divorce was permitted
1376	for that matter even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it
1377	they were beneath suspicion
1378	as the party slogan put it proles and animals are free
1379	winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer
1380	it had begun itching again
1381	the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like
1382	he took out of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage into the diary
1383	in the old days it ran before the glorious revolution london was not the beautiful city that we know today
1384	it was a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under
1385	children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water
1386	but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them
1387	these rich men were called capitalists
1388	they were fat ugly men with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite page
1389	you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which was called a top hat
1390	this was the uniform of the capitalists and no one else was allowed to wear it
1391	the capitalists owned everything in the world and everyone else was their slave
1392	they owned all the land all the houses all the factories and all the money
1393	if anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison or they could take his job away and starve him to death
1394	when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir
1395	the chief of all the capitalists was called the king and
1396	but he knew the rest of the catalogue
1397	there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes the pillory the stocks the treadmill the catonine tails the lord mayors banquet and the practice of kissing the popes toe
1398	there was also something called the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children
1399	it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories
1400	how could you tell how much of it was lies
1401	it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution
1402	the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different
1403	it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness
1404	life if you looked about you bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve
1405	great areas of it even for a party member were neutral and nonpolitical a matter of slogging through dreary jobs fighting for a place on the tube darning a wornout sock cadging a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end
1406	the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glitteringa world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weaponsa nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecutingthree hundred million people all with the same face
1407	the reality was decaying dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes in patchedup nineteenthcentury houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories
1408	he seemed to see a vision of london vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons a woman with lined face and wispy hair fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe
1409	he reached down and scratched his ankle again
1410	day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food more clothes better houses better recreationsthat they lived longer worked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people of fifty years ago
1411	not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved
1412	the party claimed for example that today per cent of adult proles were literate before the revolution it was said the number had only been per cent
1413	the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only per thousand whereas before the revolution it had been and so it went on
1414	it was like a single equation with two unknowns
1415	it might very well be that literally every word in the history books even the things that one accepted without question was pure fantasy
1416	for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat
1417	everything faded into mist
1418	the past was erased the erasure was forgotten the lie became truth
1419	just once in his life he had possessedafter the event that was what countedconcrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification
1420	he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds
1421	in it must have beenat any rate it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted
1422	but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier
1423	the story really began in the middle sixties the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all
1424	by none of them was left except big brother himself
1425	all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries
1426	goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where and of the others a few had simply disappeared while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes
1427	among the last survivors were three men named jones aaronson and rutherford
1428	it must have been in that these three had been arrested
1429	as often happened they had vanished for a year or more so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way
1430	they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too the enemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds the murder of various trusted party members intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people
1431	after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated in the party and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important
1432	all three had written long abject articles in the times analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends
1433	some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe
1434	he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye
1435	they were men far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party
1436	the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them
1437	he had the feeling though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother
1438	but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two
1439	no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end
1440	they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave
1441	there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them
1442	it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people
1443	they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe
1444	of the three it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston
1445	rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution
1446	even now at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in the times
1447	they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing
1448	always they were a rehashing of the ancient themesslum tenements starving children street battles capitalists in top hatseven on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless effort to get back into the past
1449	he was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips
1450	at one time he must have been immensely strong now his great body was sagging sloping bulging falling away in every direction
1451	he seemed to be breaking up before ones eyes like a mountain crumbling
1452	it was the lonely hour of fifteen
1453	winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time
1454	the place was almost empty
1455	a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens
1456	the three men sat in their corner almost motionless never speaking
1457	uncommanded the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin
1458	there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out but no game started
1459	and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happened to the telescreens
1460	the tune that they were playing changed and the tone of the music changed too
1461	there came into itbut it was something hard to describe
1462	it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note in his mind winston called it a yellow note
1463	and then a voice from the telescreen was singing
1464	under the spreading chestnut tree
1465	i sold you and you sold me
1466	there lie they and here lie we
1467	under the spreading chestnut tree
1468	the three men never stirred
1469	but when winston glanced again at rutherfords ruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears
1470	and for the first time he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what he shuddered that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses
1471	a little later all three were rearrested
1472	it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release
1473	at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again with a whole string of new ones
1474	they were executed and their fate was recorded in the party histories a warning to posterity
1475	about five years after this in winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten
1476	the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance
1477	it was a halfpage torn out of the times of about ten years earlierthe top half of the page so that it included the dateand it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york
1478	prominent in the middle of the group were jones aaronson and rutherford
1479	there was no mistaking them in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom
1480	the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil
1481	they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff to whom they had betrayed important military secrets
1482	the date had stuck in winstons memory because it chanced to be midsummer day but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well
1483	there was only one possible conclusion the confessions were lies
1484	of course this was not in itself a discovery
1485	even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of
1486	but this was concrete evidence it was a fragment of the abolished past like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory
1487	it was enough to blow the party to atoms if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known
1488	he had gone straight on working
1489	as soon as he saw what the photograph was and what it meant he had covered it up with another sheet of paper
1490	luckily when he unrolled it it had been upsidedown from the point of view of the telescreen
1491	he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible
1492	to keep your face expressionless was not difficult and even your breathing could be controlled with an effort but you could not control the beating of your heart and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up
1493	he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by tormented all the while by the fear that some accidenta sudden draught blowing across his desk for instancewould betray him
1494	then without uncovering it again he dropped the photograph into the memory hole along with some other waste papers
1495	within another minute perhaps it would have crumbled into ashes
1496	that was teneleven years ago
1497	today probably he would have kept that photograph
1498	it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now when the photograph itself as well as the event it recorded was only memory
1499	was the partys hold upon the past less strong he wondered because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed
1500	but today supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes the photograph might not even be evidence
1501	already at the time when he made his discovery oceania was no longer at war with eurasia and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country
1502	since then there had been other changestwo three he could not remember how many
1503	very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance
1504	the past not only changed but changed continuously
1505	what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken
1506	the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious but the ultimate motive was mysterious
1507	he took up his pen again and wrote
1508	i understand how i do not understand why
1509	he wondered as he had many times wondered before whether he himself was a lunatic
1510	perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one
1511	at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun today to believe that the past is unalterable
1512	he might be alone in holding that belief and if alone then a lunatic
1513	but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him the horror was that he might also be wrong
1514	he picked up the childrens history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece
1515	the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own
1516	it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon yousomething that penetrated inside your skull battering against your brain frightening you out of your beliefs persuading you almost to deny the evidence of your senses
1517	in the end the party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it
1518	it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
1519	not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy
1520	the heresy of heresies was common sense
1521	and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise but that they might be right
1522	for after all how do we know that two and two make four
1523	or that the force of gravity works
1524	or that the past is unchangeable
1525	if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable what then
1526	but no
1527	his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord
1528	the face of obrien not called up by any obvious association had floated into his mind
1529	he knew with more certainty than before that obrien was on his side
1530	he was writing the diary for obriento obrien it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact
1531	the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears
1532	it was their final most essential command
1533	his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand much less answer
1534	and yet he was in the right
1535	they were wrong and he was right
1536	the obvious the silly and the true had got to be defended
1537	truisms are true hold on to that
1538	the solid world exists its laws do not change
1539	stones are hard water is wet objects unsupported fall towards the earths centre
1540	with the feeling that he was speaking to obrien and also that he was setting forth an important axiom he wrote
1541	freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four
1542	if that is granted all else follows
1543	chapter
1544	from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffeereal coffee not victory coffeecame floating out into the street
1545	winston paused involuntarily
1546	for perhaps two seconds he was back in the halfforgotten world of his childhood
1547	then a door banged seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound
1548	he had walked several kilometres over pavements and his varicose ulcer was throbbing
1549	this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre a rash act since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked
1550	in principle a party member had no spare time and was never alone except in bed
1551	it was assumed that when he was not working eating or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude even to go for a walk by yourself was always slightly dangerous
1552	there was a word for it in newspeak ownlife it was called meaning individualism and eccentricity
1553	but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him
1554	the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year and suddenly the long noisy evening at the centre the boring exhausting games the lectures the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin had seemed intolerable
1555	on impulse he had turned away from the busstop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london first south then east then north again losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going
1556	if there is hope he had written in the diary it lies in the proles
1557	the words kept coming back to him statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity
1558	he was somewhere in the vague browncoloured slums to the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station
1559	he was walking up a cobbled street of little twostorey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes
1560	there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles
1561	in and out of the dark doorways and down narrow alleyways that branched off on either side people swarmed in astonishing numbersgirls in full bloom with crudely lipsticked mouths and youths who chased the girls and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers
1562	perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up
1563	most of the people paid no attention to winston a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity
1564	two monstrous women with brickred forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway
1565	winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached
1566	yes i says to er thats all very well i says
1567	but if youd of been in my place youd of done the same as what i done
1568	its easy to criticize i says but you aint got the same problems as what i got
1569	ah said the other thats jest it
1570	thats jest where it is
1571	the strident voices stopped abruptly
1572	the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past
1573	but it was not hostility exactly merely a kind of wariness a momentary stiffening as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal
1574	the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this
1575	indeed it was unwise to be seen in such places unless you had definite business there
1576	the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them
1577	may i see your papers comrade
1578	what are you doing here
1579	what time did you leave work
1580	is this your usual way home
1581	and so on and so forth
1582	not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it
1583	suddenly the whole street was in commotion
1584	there were yells of warning from all sides
1585	people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits
1586	a young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle whipped her apron round it and leapt back again all in one movement
1587	at the same instant a man in a concertinalike black suit who had emerged from a side alley ran towards winston pointing excitedly to the sky
1588	steamer
1589	he yelled
1590	look out guvnor
1591	bang overead
1592	lay down quick
1593	steamer was a nickname which for some reason the proles applied to rocket bombs
1594	winston promptly flung himself on his face
1595	the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind
1596	they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound
1597	winston clasped his forearms above his head
1598	there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave a shower of light objects pattered on to his back
1599	when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window
1600	he walked on
1601	the bomb had demolished a group of houses metres up the street
1602	a black plume of smoke hung in the sky and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins
1603	there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak
1604	when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist
1605	apart from the bloody stump the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast
1606	he kicked the thing into the gutter and then to avoid the crowd turned down a sidestreet to the right
1607	within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened
1608	it was nearly twenty hours and the drinkingshops which the proles frequented pubs they called them were choked with customers
1609	from their grimy swing doors endlessly opening and shutting there came forth a smell of urine sawdust and sour beer
1610	in an angle formed by a projecting housefront three men were standing very close together the middle one of them holding a foldedup newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder
1611	even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies
1612	it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading
1613	he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation
1614	for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows
1615	cant you bleeding well listen to what i say
1616	i tell you no number ending in seven aint won for over fourteen months
1617	yes it as then
1618	no it as not
1619	back ome i got the ole lot of em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper
1620	i takes em down reglar as the clock
1621	an i tell you no number ending in seven
1622	yes a seven as won
1623	i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number
1624	four oh seven it ended in
1625	it were in februarysecond week in february
1626	february your grandmother
1627	i got it all down in black and white
1628	an i tell you no number
1629	oh pack it in
1630	said the third man
1631	they were talking about the lottery
1632	winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres
1633	they were still arguing with vivid passionate faces
1634	the lottery with its weekly payout of enormous prizes was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention
1635	it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive
1636	it was their delight their folly their anodyne their intellectual stimulant
1637	where the lottery was concerned even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory
1638	there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems forecasts and lucky amulets
1639	winston had nothing to do with the running of the lottery which was managed by the ministry of plenty but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes were largely imaginary
1640	only small sums were actually paid out the winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons
1641	in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another this was not difficult to arrange
1642	but if there was hope it lay in the proles
1643	you had to cling on to that
1644	when you put it in words it sounded reasonable it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith
1645	the street into which he had turned ran downhill
1646	he had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away
1647	from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices
1648	the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tiredlooking vegetables
1649	at this moment winston remembered where he was
1650	the alley led out into the main street and down the next turning not five minutes away was the junkshop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary
1651	and in a small stationers shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink
1652	he paused for a moment at the top of the steps
1653	on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust
1654	a very old man bent but active with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn pushed open the swing door and went in
1655	as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man who must be eighty at the least had already been middleaged when the revolution happened
1656	he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism
1657	in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution
1658	the older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender
1659	if there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century it could only be a prole
1660	suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into winstons mind and a lunatic impulse took hold of him
1661	he would go into the pub he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him
1662	he would say to him tell me about your life when you were a boy
1663	what was it like in those days
1664	were things better than they are now or were they worse
1665	hurriedly lest he should have time to become frightened he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street
1666	it was madness of course
1667	as usual there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed
1668	if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness but it was not likely that they would believe him
1669	he pushed open the door and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face
1670	as he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume
1671	behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls
1672	a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds
1673	the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar having some kind of altercation with the barman a large stout hooknosed young man with enormous forearms
1674	a knot of others standing round with glasses in their hands were watching the scene
1675	i arst you civil enough didnt i
1676	said the old man straightening his shoulders pugnaciously
1677	you telling me you aint got a pint mug in the ole bleeding boozer
1678	and what in hells name is a pint
1679	said the barman leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter
1680	ark at im
1681	calls isself a barman and dont know what a pint is
1682	why a pints the alf of a quart and theres four quarts to the gallon
1683	ave to teach you the a b c next
1684	never heard of em said the barman shortly
1685	litre and half litrethats all we serve
1686	theres the glasses on the shelf in front of you
1687	i likes a pint persisted the old man
1688	you could a drawed me off a pint easy enough
1689	we didnt ave these bleeding litres when i was a young man
1690	when you were a young man we were all living in the treetops said the barman with a glance at the other customers
1691	there was a shout of laughter and the uneasiness caused by winstons entry seemed to disappear
1692	the old mans whitestubbled face had flushed pink
1693	he turned away muttering to himself and bumped into winston
1694	winston caught him gently by the arm
1695	may i offer you a drink
1696	he said
1697	youre a gent said the other straightening his shoulders again
1698	he appeared not to have noticed winstons blue overalls
1699	pint
1700	he added aggressively to the barman
1701	pint of wallop
1702	the barman swished two halflitres of darkbrown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter
1703	beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs
1704	the proles were supposed not to drink gin though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough
1705	the game of darts was in full swing again and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets
1706	winstons presence was forgotten for a moment
1707	there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard
1708	it was horribly dangerous but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in
1709	e could a drawed me off a pint grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass
1710	a alf litre aint enough
1711	it dont satisfy
1712	and a ole litres too much
1713	it starts my bladder running
1714	let alone the price
1715	you must have seen great changes since you were a young man said winston tentatively
1716	the old mans pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar and from the bar to the door of the gents as though it were in the barroom that he expected the changes to have occurred
1717	the beer was better he said finally
1718	and cheaper
1719	when i was a young man mild beerwallop we used to call itwas fourpence a pint
1720	that was before the war of course
1721	which war was that
1722	said winston
1723	its all wars said the old man vaguely
1724	he took up his glass and his shoulders straightened again
1725	eres wishing you the very best of ealth
1726	in his lean throat the sharppointed adams apple made a surprisingly rapid upanddown movement and the beer vanished
1727	winston went to the bar and came back with two more halflitres
1728	the old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre
1729	you are very much older than i am said winston
1730	you must have been a grown man before i was born
1731	you can remember what it was like in the old days before the revolution
1732	people of my age dont really know anything about those times
1733	we can only read about them in books and what it says in the books may not be true
1734	i should like your opinion on that
1735	the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now
1736	there was the most terrible oppression injustice poverty worse than anything we can imagine
1737	here in london the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death
1738	half of them hadnt even boots on their feet
1739	they worked twelve hours a day they left school at nine they slept ten in a room
1740	and at the same time there were a very few people only a few thousandsthe capitalists they were calledwho were rich and powerful
1741	they owned everything that there was to own
1742	they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants they rode about in motorcars and fourhorse carriages they drank champagne they wore top hats
1743	the old man brightened suddenly
1744	top ats
1745	he said
1746	funny you should mention em
1747	the same thing come into my ead only yesterday i dono why
1748	i was jest thinking i aint seen a top at in years
1749	gorn right out they ave
1750	the last time i wore one was at my sisterinlaws funeral
1751	and that waswell i couldnt give you the date but it musta been fifty years ago
1752	of course it was only ired for the occasion you understand
1753	it isnt very important about the top hats said winston patiently
1754	the point is these capitaliststhey and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on themwere the lords of the earth
1755	everything existed for their benefit
1756	youthe ordinary people the workerswere their slaves
1757	they could do what they liked with you
1758	they could ship you off to canada like cattle
1759	they could sleep with your daughters if they chose
1760	they could order you to be flogged with something called a catonine tails
1761	you had to take your cap off when you passed them
1762	every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who
1763	the old man brightened again
1764	lackeys
1765	he said
1766	now theres a word i aint eard since ever so long
1767	lackeys
1768	that reglar takes me back that does
1769	i recollectoh donkeys years agoi used to sometimes go to yde park of a sunday afternoon to ear the blokes making speeches
1770	salvation army roman catholics jews indiansall sorts there was
1771	and there was one blokewell i couldnt give you is name but a real powerful speaker e was
1772	e didnt alf give it em
1773	lackeys
1774	e says lackeys of the bourgeoisie
1775	flunkies of the ruling class
1776	parasitesthat was another of them
1777	and yenase definitely called em yenas
1778	of course e was referring to the labour party you understand
1779	winston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposes
1780	what i really wanted to know was this he said
1781	do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days
1782	are you treated more like a human being
1783	in the old days the rich people the people at the top
1784	the ouse of lords put in the old man reminiscently
1785	the house of lords if you like
1786	what i am asking is were these people able to treat you as an inferior simply because they were rich and you were poor
1787	is it a fact for instance that you had to call them sir and take off your cap when you passed them
1788	the old man appeared to think deeply
1789	he drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering
1790	yes he said
1791	they liked you to touch your cap to em
1792	it showed respect like
1793	i didnt agree with it myself but i done it often enough
1794	had to as you might say
1795	and was it usualim only quoting what ive read in history bookswas it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter
1796	one of em pushed me once said the old man
1797	i recollect it as if it was yesterday
1798	it was boat race nightterribly rowdy they used to get on boat race nightand i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue
1799	quite a gent e wasdress shirt top at black overcoat
1800	e was kind of zigzagging across the pavement and i bumps into im accidentallike
1801	e says why cant you look where youre going
1802	e says
1803	i say ju think youve bought the bleeding pavement
1804	e says ill twist your bloody ead off if you get fresh with me
1805	i says youre drunk
1806	ill give you in charge in alf a minute i says
1807	an if youll believe me e puts is and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus
1808	well i was young in them days and i was going to ave fetched im one only
1809	a sense of helplessness took hold of winston
1810	the old mans memory was nothing but a rubbishheap of details
1811	one could question him all day without getting any real information
1812	the party histories might still be true after a fashion they might even be completely true
1813	he made a last attempt
1814	perhaps i have not made myself clear he said
1815	what im trying to say is this
1816	you have been alive a very long time you lived half your life before the revolution
1817	in for instance you were already grown up
1818	would you say from what you can remember that life in was better than it is now or worse
1819	if you could choose would you prefer to live then or now
1820	the old man looked meditatively at the darts board
1821	he finished up his beer more slowly than before
1822	when he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air as though the beer had mellowed him
1823	i know what you expect me to say he said
1824	you expect me to say as id sooner be young again
1825	most peopled say theyd sooner be young if you arst em
1826	you got your ealth and strength when youre young
1827	when you get to my time of life you aint never well
1828	i suffer something wicked from my feet and my bladders jest terrible
1829	six and seven times a night it as me out of bed
1830	on the other and theres great advantages in being a old man
1831	you aint got the same worries
1832	no truck with women and thats a great thing
1833	i aint ad a woman for near on thirty year if youd credit it
1834	nor wanted to whats more
1835	winston sat back against the windowsill
1836	it was no use going on
1837	he was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room
1838	the extra halflitre was already working on him
1839	winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again
1840	within twenty years at the most he reflected the huge and simple question was life better before the revolution than it is now
1841	would have ceased once and for all to be answerable
1842	but in effect it was unanswerable even now since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another
1843	they remembered a million useless things a quarrel with a workmate a hunt for a lost bicycle pump the expression on a longdead sisters face the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision
1844	they were like the ant which can see small objects but not large ones
1845	and when memory failed and written records were falsifiedwhen that happened the claim of the party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted because there did not exist and never again could exist any standard against which it could be tested
1846	at this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly
1847	he halted and looked up
1848	he was in a narrow street with a few dark little shops interspersed among dwellinghouses
1849	immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded
1850	he seemed to know the place
1851	of course
1852	he was standing outside the junkshop where he had bought the diary
1853	a twinge of fear went through him
1854	it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning and he had sworn never to come near the place again
1855	and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander his feet had brought him back here of their own accord
1856	it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary
1857	at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twentyone hours the shop was still open
1858	with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement he stepped through the doorway
1859	if questioned he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades
1860	the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell
1861	he was a man of perhaps sixty frail and bowed with a long benevolent nose and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles
1862	his hair was almost white but his eyebrows were bushy and still black
1863	his spectacles his gentle fussy movements and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet gave him a vague air of intellectuality as though he had been some kind of literary man or perhaps a musician
1864	his voice was soft as though faded and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles
1865	i recognized you on the pavement he said immediately
1866	youre the gentleman that bought the young ladys keepsake album
1867	that was a beautiful bit of paper that was
1868	creamlaid it used to be called
1869	theres been no paper like that made foroh i dare say fifty years
1870	he peered at winston over the top of his spectacles
1871	is there anything special i can do for you
1872	or did you just want to look round
1873	i was passing said winston vaguely
1874	i just looked in
1875	i dont want anything in particular
1876	its just as well said the other because i dont suppose i could have satisfied you
1877	he made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand
1878	you see how it is an empty shop you might say
1879	between you and me the antique trades just about finished
1880	no demand any longer and no stock either
1881	furniture china glass its all been broken up by degrees
1882	and of course the metal stuffs mostly been melted down
1883	i havent seen a brass candlestick in years
1884	the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value
1885	the floorspace was very restricted because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty pictureframes
1886	in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts wornout chisels penknives with broken blades tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order and other miscellaneous rubbish
1887	only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and endslacquered snuffboxes agate brooches and the likewhich looked as though they might include something interesting
1888	as winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight and he picked it up
1889	it was a heavy lump of glass curved on one side flat on the other making almost a hemisphere
1890	there was a peculiar softness as of rainwater in both the colour and the texture of the glass
1891	at the heart of it magnified by the curved surface there was a strange pink convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone
1892	what is it
1893	said winston fascinated
1894	thats coral that is said the old man
1895	it must have come from the indian ocean
1896	they used to kind of embed it in the glass
1897	that wasnt made less than a hundred years ago
1898	more by the look of it
1899	its a beautiful thing said winston
1900	it is a beautiful thing said the other appreciatively
1901	but theres not many thatd say so nowadays
1902	he coughed
1903	now if it so happened that you wanted to buy it thatd cost you four dollars
1904	i can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds and eight pounds waswell i cant work it out but it was a lot of money
1905	but who cares about genuine antiques nowadayseven the few thats left
1906	winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket
1907	what appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one
1908	the soft rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen
1909	the thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight
1910	it was very heavy in his pocket but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge
1911	it was a queer thing even a compromising thing for a party member to have in his possession
1912	anything old and for that matter anything beautiful was always vaguely suspect
1913	the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars
1914	winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two
1915	theres another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at he said
1916	theres not much in it
1917	just a few pieces
1918	well do with a light if were going upstairs
1919	he lit another lamp and with bowed back led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimneypots
1920	winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in
1921	there was a strip of carpet on the floor a picture or two on the walls and a deep slatternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace
1922	an oldfashioned glass clock with a twelvehour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece
1923	under the window and occupying nearly a quarter of the room was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it
1924	we lived here till my wife died said the old man half apologetically
1925	im selling the furniture off by little and little
1926	now thats a beautiful mahogany bed or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it
1927	but i dare say youd find it a little bit cumbersome
1928	he was holding the lamp high up so as to illuminate the whole room and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting
1929	the thought flitted through winstons mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week if he dared to take the risk
1930	it was a wild impossible notion to be abandoned as soon as thought of but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia a sort of ancestral memory
1931	it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob utterly alone utterly secure with nobody watching you no voice pursuing you no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock
1932	theres no telescreen
1933	he could not help murmuring
1934	ah said the old man i never had one of those things
1935	too expensive
1936	and i never seemed to feel the need of it somehow
1937	now thats a nice gateleg table in the corner there
1938	though of course youd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps
1939	there was a small bookcase in the other corner and winston had already gravitated towards it
1940	it contained nothing but rubbish
1941	the huntingdown and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else
1942	it was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than
1943	the old man still carrying the lamp was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace opposite the bed
1944	now if you happen to be interested in old prints at all he began delicately
1945	winston came across to examine the picture
1946	it was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows and a small tower in front
1947	there was a railing running round the building and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue
1948	winston gazed at it for some moments
1949	it seemed vaguely familiar though he did not remember the statue
1950	the frames fixed to the wall said the old man but i could unscrew it for you i dare say
1951	i know that building said winston finally
1952	its a ruin now
1953	its in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice
1954	thats right
1955	outside the law courts
1956	it was bombed inoh many years ago
1957	it was a church at one time st clement danes its name was
1958	he smiled apologetically as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous and added oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
1959	whats that
1960	said winston
1961	ohoranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
1962	that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy
1963	how it goes on i dont remember but i do know it ended up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head
1964	it was a kind of a dance
1965	they held out their arms for you to pass under and when they came to here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you
1966	it was just names of churches
1967	all the london churches were in itall the principal ones that is
1968	winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged
1969	it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building
1970	anything large and impressive if it was reasonably new in appearance was automatically claimed as having been built since the revolution while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middle ages
1971	the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value
1972	one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books
1973	statues inscriptions memorial stones the names of streetsanything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered
1974	i never knew it had been a church he said
1975	theres a lot of them left really said the old man though theyve been put to other uses
1976	now how did that rhyme go
1977	ah
1978	ive got it
1979	oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
1980	you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins
1981	there now thats as far as i can get
1982	a farthing that was a small copper coin looked something like a cent
1983	where was st martins
1984	said winston
1985	st martins
1986	thats still standing
1987	its in victory square alongside the picture gallery
1988	a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front and a big flight of steps
1989	winston knew the place well
1990	it was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kindsscale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresses waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities and the like
1991	st martinsinthefields it used to be called supplemented the old man though i dont recollect any fields anywhere in those parts
1992	winston did not buy the picture
1993	it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight and impossible to carry home unless it were taken out of its frame
1994	but he lingered for some minutes more talking to the old man whose name he discovered was not weeksas one might have gathered from the inscription over the shopfrontbut charrington
1995	mr charrington it seemed was a widower aged sixtythree and had inhabited this shop for thirty years
1996	throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window but had never quite got to the point of doing it
1997	all the while that they were talking the halfremembered rhyme kept running through winstons head
1998	oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins
1999	it was curious but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other disguised and forgotten
2000	from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth
2001	yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing
2002	he got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door
2003	he had already made up his mind that after a suitable intervala month sayhe would take the risk of visiting the shop again
2004	it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centre
2005	the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted
2006	however
2007	yes he thought again he would come back
2008	he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish
2009	he would buy the engraving of st clement danes take it out of its frame and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls
2010	he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charringtons memory
2011	even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again
2012	for perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window
2013	he had even started humming to an improvised tune
2014	oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
2015	you owe me three farthings say the
2016	suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water
2017	a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement not ten metres away
2018	it was the girl from the fiction department the girl with dark hair
2019	the light was failing but there was no difficulty in recognizing her
2020	she looked him straight in the face then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him
2021	for a few seconds winston was too paralysed to move
2022	then he turned to the right and walked heavily away not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction
2023	at any rate one question was settled
2024	there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him
2025	she must have followed him here because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet kilometres distant from any quarter where party members lived
2026	it was too great a coincidence
2027	whether she was really an agent of the thought police or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness hardly mattered
2028	it was enough that she was watching him
2029	probably she had seen him go into the pub as well
2030	it was an effort to walk
2031	the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away
2032	the worst thing was the pain in his belly
2033	for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon
2034	but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this
2035	then the spasm passed leaving a dull ache behind
2036	the street was a blind alley
2037	winston halted stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do then turned round and began to retrace his steps
2038	as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her
2039	he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone
2040	the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job
2041	but he abandoned the idea immediately because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable
2042	he could not run he could not strike a blow
2043	besides she was young and lusty and would defend herself
2044	he thought also of hurrying to the community centre and staying there till the place closed so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening
2045	but that too was impossible
2046	a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him
2047	all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet
2048	it was after twentytwo hours when he got back to the flat
2049	the lights would be switched off at the main at twentythree thirty
2050	he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin
2051	then he went to the table in the alcove sat down and took the diary out of the drawer
2052	but he did not open it at once
2053	from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song
2054	he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness
2055	it was at night that they came for you always at night
2056	the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you
2057	undoubtedly some people did so
2058	many of the disappearances were actually suicides
2059	but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms or any quick and certain poison were completely unprocurable
2060	he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed
2061	he might have silenced the darkhaired girl if only he had acted quickly enough but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act
2062	it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy but always against ones own body
2063	even now in spite of the gin the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible
2064	and it is the same he perceived in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations
2065	on the battlefield in the torture chamber on a sinking ship the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten because the body swells up until it fills the universe and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain life is a momenttomoment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness against a sour stomach or an aching tooth
2066	he opened the diary
2067	it was important to write something down
2068	the woman on the telescreen had started a new song
2069	her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass
2070	he tried to think of obrien for whom or to whom the diary was written but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away
2071	it would not matter if they killed you at once
2072	to be killed was what you expected
2073	but before death nobody spoke of such things yet everybody knew of them there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy the crack of broken bones the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair
2074	why did you have to endure it since the end was always the same
2075	why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life
2076	nobody ever escaped detection and nobody ever failed to confess
2077	when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead
2078	why then did that horror which altered nothing have to lie embedded in future time
2079	he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of obrien
2080	we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness obrien had said to him
2081	he knew what it meant or thought he knew
2082	the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future which one would never see but which by foreknowledge one could mystically share in
2083	but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further
2084	he put a cigarette in his mouth
2085	half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again
2086	the face of big brother swam into his mind displacing that of obrien
2087	just as he had done a few days earlier he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it
2088	the face gazed up at him heavy calm protecting but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache
2089	like a leaden knell the words came back at him
2090	war is peace
2091	freedom is slavery
2092	ignorance is strength
2093	part two
2094	chapter
2095	it was the middle of the morning and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory
2096	a solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long brightlylit corridor
2097	it was the girl with dark hair
2098	four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junkshop
2099	as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls
2100	probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were roughed in
2101	it was a common accident in the fiction department
2102	they were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face
2103	a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her
2104	she must have fallen right on the injured arm
2105	winston stopped short
2106	the girl had risen to her knees
2107	her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever
2108	her eyes were fixed on his with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain
2109	a curious emotion stirred in winstons heart
2110	in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him in front of him also was a human creature in pain and perhaps with a broken bone
2111	already he had instinctively started forward to help her
2112	in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body
2113	youre hurt
2114	he said
2115	its nothing
2116	my arm
2117	itll be all right in a second
2118	she spoke as though her heart were fluttering
2119	she had certainly turned very pale
2120	you havent broken anything
2121	no im all right
2122	it hurt for a moment thats all
2123	she held out her free hand to him and he helped her up
2124	she had regained some of her colour and appeared very much better
2125	its nothing she repeated shortly
2126	i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang
2127	thanks comrade
2128	and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going as briskly as though it had really been nothing
2129	the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute
2130	not to let ones feelings appear in ones face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened
2131	nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand
2132	there was no question that she had done it intentionally
2133	it was something small and flat
2134	as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers
2135	it was a scrap of paper folded into a square
2136	while he stood at the urinal he managed with a little more fingering to get it unfolded
2137	obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it
2138	for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the waterclosets and read it at once
2139	but that would be shocking folly as he well knew
2140	there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously
2141	he went back to his cubicle sat down threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him
2142	five minutes he told himself five minutes at the very least
2143	his heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness
2144	fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine the rectification of a long list of figures not needing close attention
2145	whatever was written on the paper it must have some kind of political meaning
2146	so far as he could see there were two possibilities
2147	one much the more likely was that the girl was an agent of the thought police just as he had feared
2148	he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion but perhaps they had their reasons
2149	the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat a summons an order to commit suicide a trap of some description
2150	but there was another wilder possibility that kept raising its head though he tried vainly to suppress it
2151	this was that the message did not come from the thought police at all but from some kind of underground organization
2152	perhaps the brotherhood existed after all
2153	perhaps the girl was part of it
2154	no doubt the idea was absurd but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand
2155	it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other more probable explanation had occurred to him
2156	and even now though his intellect told him that the message probably meant deathstill that was not what he believed and the unreasonable hope persisted and his heart banged and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite
2157	he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube
2158	eight minutes had gone by
2159	he readjusted his spectacles on his nose sighed and drew the next batch of work towards him with the scrap of paper on top of it
2160	he flattened it out
2161	on it was written in a large unformed handwriting
2162	i love you
2163	for several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole
2164	when he did so although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest he could not resist reading it once again just to make sure that the words were really there
2165	for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work
2166	what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen
2167	he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly
2168	lunch in the hot crowded noisefilled canteen was torment
2169	he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped down beside him the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week
2170	he was particularly enthusiastic about a papiermache model of big brothers head two metres wide which was being made for the occasion by his daughters troop of spies
2171	the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated
2172	just once he caught a glimpse of the girl at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room
2173	she appeared not to have seen him and he did not look in that direction again
2174	the afternoon was more bearable
2175	immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside
2176	it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who was now under a cloud
2177	this was the kind of thing that winston was good at and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether
2178	then the memory of her face came back and with it a raging intolerable desire to be alone
2179	until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out
2180	tonight was one of his nights at the community centre
2181	he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen hurried off to the centre took part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group played two games of table tennis swallowed several glasses of gin and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ingsoc in relation to chess
2182	his soul writhed with boredom but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre
2183	at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid
2184	it was not till twentythree hours when he was home and in bedin the darkness where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silentthat he was able to think continuously
2185	it was a physical problem that had to be solved how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting
2186	he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him
2187	he knew that it was not so because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note
2188	obviously she had been frightened out of her wits as well she might be
2189	nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind
2190	only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone but that was of no importance
2191	he thought of her naked youthful body as he had seen it in his dream
2192	he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them her head stuffed with lies and hatred her belly full of ice
2193	a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her the white youthful body might slip away from him
2194	what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly
2195	but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous
2196	it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated
2197	whichever way you turned the telescreen faced you
2198	actually all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note but now with time to think he went over them one by one as though laying out a row of instruments on a table
2199	obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated
2200	if she had worked in the records department it might have been comparatively simple but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay and he had no pretext for going there
2201	if he had known where she lived and at what time she left work he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home but to try to follow her home was not safe because it would mean loitering about outside the ministry which was bound to be noticed
2202	as for sending a letter through the mails it was out of the question
2203	by a routine that was not even secret all letters were opened in transit
2204	actually few people ever wrote letters
2205	for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable
2206	in any case he did not know the girls name let alone her address
2207	finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen
2208	if he could get her at a table by herself somewhere in the middle of the room not too near the telescreens and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all roundif these conditions endured for say thirty seconds it might be possible to exchange a few words
2209	for a week after this life was like a restless dream
2210	on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it the whistle having already blown
2211	presumably she had been changed on to a later shift
2212	they passed each other without a glance
2213	on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen
2214	then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all
2215	his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity a sort of transparency which made every movement every sound every contact every word that he had to speak or listen to an agony
2216	even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image
2217	he did not touch the diary during those days
2218	if there was any relief it was in his work in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch
2219	he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her
2220	there was no enquiry he could make
2221	she might have been vaporized she might have committed suicide she might have been transferred to the other end of oceania worst and likeliest of all she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him
2222	the next day she reappeared
2223	her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of stickingplaster round her wrist
2224	the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds
2225	on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her
2226	when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall and was quite alone
2227	it was early and the place was not very full
2228	the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine
2229	but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table
2230	he walked casually towards her his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her
2231	she was perhaps three metres away from him
2232	another two seconds would do it
2233	then a voice behind him called smith
2234	he pretended not to hear
2235	smith
2236	repeated the voice more loudly
2237	it was no use
2238	he turned round
2239	a blondheaded sillyfaced young man named wilsher whom he barely knew was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table
2240	it was not safe to refuse
2241	after having been recognized he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl
2242	it was too noticeable
2243	he sat down with a friendly smile
2244	the silly blond face beamed into his
2245	winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it
2246	the girls table filled up a few minutes later
2247	but she must have seen him coming towards her and perhaps she would take the hint
2248	next day he took care to arrive early
2249	surely enough she was at a table in about the same place and again alone
2250	the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small swiftlymoving beetlelike man with a flat face and tiny suspicious eyes
2251	as winston turned away from the counter with his tray he saw that the little man was making straight for the girls table
2252	his hopes sank again
2253	there was a vacant place at a table further away but something in the little mans appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table
2254	with ice at his heart winston followed
2255	it was no use unless he could get the girl alone
2256	at this moment there was a tremendous crash
2257	the little man was sprawling on all fours his tray had gone flying two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor
2258	he started to his feet with a malignant glance at winston whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up
2259	but it was all right
2260	five seconds later with a thundering heart winston was sitting at the girls table
2261	he did not look at her
2262	he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating
2263	it was allimportant to speak at once before anyone else came but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him
2264	a week had gone by since she had first approached him
2265	she would have changed her mind she must have changed her mind
2266	it was impossible that this affair should end successfully such things did not happen in real life
2267	he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth the hairyeared poet wandering limply round the room with a tray looking for a place to sit down
2268	in his vague way ampleforth was attached to winston and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him
2269	there was perhaps a minute in which to act
2270	both winston and the girl were eating steadily
2271	the stuff they were eating was a thin stew actually a soup of haricot beans
2272	in a low murmur winston began speaking
2273	neither of them looked up steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices
2274	what time do you leave work
2275	eighteenthirty
2276	where can we meet
2277	victory square near the monument
2278	its full of telescreens
2279	it doesnt matter if theres a crowd
2280	any signal
2281	no
2282	dont come up to me until you see me among a lot of people
2283	and dont look at me
2284	just keep somewhere near me
2285	what time
2286	nineteen hours
2287	all right
2288	ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table
2289	they did not speak again and so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table they did not look at one another
2290	the girl finished her lunch quickly and made off while winston stayed to smoke a cigarette
2291	winston was in victory square before the appointed time
2292	he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column at the top of which big brothers statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the eurasian aeroplanes the eastasian aeroplanes it had been a few years ago in the battle of airstrip one
2293	in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell
2294	at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared
2295	again the terrible fear seized upon winston
2296	she was not coming she had changed her mind
2297	he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of palecoloured pleasure from identifying st martins church whose bells when it had bells had chimed you owe me three farthings
2298	then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column
2299	it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated
2300	there were telescreens all round the pediment
2301	but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left
2302	suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square
2303	the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush
2304	winston followed
2305	as he ran he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of eurasian prisoners was passing
2306	already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square
2307	winston at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage shoved butted squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd
2308	soon he was within arms length of the girl but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman presumably his wife who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh
2309	winston wriggled himself sideways and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them
2310	for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips then he had broken through sweating a little
2311	he was next to the girl
2312	they were shoulder to shoulder both staring fixedly in front of them
2313	a long line of trucks with woodenfaced guards armed with submachine guns standing upright in each corner was passing slowly down the street
2314	in the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting jammed close together
2315	their sad mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious
2316	occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of metal all the prisoners were wearing legirons
2317	truckload after truckload of the sad faces passed
2318	winston knew they were there but he saw them only intermittently
2319	the girls shoulder and her arm right down to the elbow were pressed against his
2320	her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth
2321	she had immediately taken charge of the situation just as she had done in the canteen
2322	she began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before with lips barely moving a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks
2323	can you hear me
2324	yes
2325	can you get sunday afternoon off
2326	yes
2327	then listen carefully
2328	youll have to remember this
2329	go to paddington station
2330	with a sort of military precision that astonished him she outlined the route that he was to follow
2331	a halfhour railway journey turn left outside the station two kilometres along the road a gate with the top bar missing a path across a field a grassgrown lane a track between bushes a dead tree with moss on it
2332	it was as though she had a map inside her head
2333	can you remember all that
2334	she murmured finally
2335	yes
2336	you turn left then right then left again
2337	and the gates got no top bar
2338	yes
2339	what time
2340	about fifteen
2341	you may have to wait
2342	ill get there by another way
2343	are you sure you remember everything
2344	yes
2345	then get away from me as quick as you can
2346	she need not have told him that
2347	but for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd
2348	the trucks were still filing past the people still insatiably gaping
2349	at the start there had been a few boos and hisses but it came only from the party members among the crowd and had soon stopped
2350	the prevailing emotion was simply curiosity
2351	foreigners whether from eurasia or from eastasia were a kind of strange animal
2352	one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them
2353	nor did one know what became of them apart from the few who were hanged as warcriminals the others simply vanished presumably into forcedlabour camps
2354	the round mogol faces had given way to faces of a more european type dirty bearded and exhausted
2355	from over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into winstons sometimes with strange intensity and flashed away again
2356	the convoy was drawing to an end
2357	in the last truck he could see an aged man his face a mass of grizzled hair standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him as though he were used to having them bound together
2358	it was almost time for winston and the girl to part
2359	but at the last moment while the crowd still hemmed them in her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze
2360	it could not have been ten seconds and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together
2361	he had time to learn every detail of her hand
2362	he explored the long fingers the shapely nails the workhardened palm with its row of callouses the smooth flesh under the wrist
2363	merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight
2364	in the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girls eyes were
2365	they were probably brown but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes
2366	to turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly
2367	with hands locked together invisible among the press of bodies they stared steadily in front of them and instead of the eyes of the girl the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at winston out of nests of hair
2368	chapter
2369	winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted
2370	under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells
2371	the air seemed to kiss ones skin
2372	it was the second of may
2373	from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ringdoves
2374	he was a bit early
2375	there had been no difficulties about the journey and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been
2376	presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place
2377	in general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in london
2378	there were no telescreens of course but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized besides it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention
2379	for distances of less than kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations who examined the papers of any party member they found there and asked awkward questions
2380	however no patrols had appeared and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed
2381	the train was full of proles in holiday mood because of the summery weather
2382	the woodenseated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family ranging from a toothless greatgrandmother to a monthold baby going out to spend an afternoon with inlaws in the country and as they freely explained to winston to get hold of a little blackmarket butter
2383	the lane widened and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of a mere cattletrack which plunged between the bushes
2384	he had no watch but it could not be fifteen yet
2385	the bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them
2386	he knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met
2387	he had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs
2388	he went on picking bluebells
2389	it was the best thing to do
2390	it might be the girl or he might have been followed after all
2391	to look round was to show guilt
2392	he picked another and another
2393	a hand fell lightly on his shoulder
2394	he looked up
2395	it was the girl
2396	she shook her head evidently as a warning that he must keep silent then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood
2397	obviously she had been that way before for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit
2398	winston followed still clasping his bunch of flowers
2399	his first feeling was relief but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him
2400	even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all
2401	the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him
2402	already on the walk from the station the may sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated a creature of indoors with the sooty dust of london in the pores of his skin
2403	it occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open
2404	they came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of
2405	the girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes in which there did not seem to be an opening
2406	when winston followed her he found that they were in a natural clearing a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely
2407	the girl stopped and turned
2408	here we are she said
2409	he was facing her at several paces distance
2410	as yet he did not dare move nearer to her
2411	i didnt want to say anything in the lane she went on in case theres a mike hidden there
2412	i dont suppose there is but there could be
2413	theres always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice
2414	were all right here
2415	he still had not the courage to approach her
2416	were all right here
2417	he repeated stupidly
2418	yes
2419	look at the trees
2420	they were small ashes which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles none of them thicker than ones wrist
2421	theres nothing big enough to hide a mike in
2422	besides ive been here before
2423	they were only making conversation
2424	he had managed to move closer to her now
2425	she stood before him very upright with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act
2426	the bluebells had cascaded on to the ground
2427	they seemed to have fallen of their own accord
2428	he took her hand
2429	would you believe he said that till this moment i didnt know what colour your eyes were
2430	they were brown he noted a rather light shade of brown with dark lashes
2431	now that youve seen what im really like can you still bear to look at me
2432	yes easily
2433	im thirtynine years old
2434	ive got a wife that i cant get rid of
2435	ive got varicose veins
2436	ive got five false teeth
2437	i couldnt care less said the girl
2438	the next moment it was hard to say by whose act she was in his arms
2439	at the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity
2440	the youthful body was strained against his own the mass of dark hair was against his face and yes
2441	actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth
2442	she had clasped her arms about his neck she was calling him darling precious one loved one
2443	he had pulled her down on to the ground she was utterly unresisting he could do what he liked with her
2444	but the truth was that he had no physical sensation except that of mere contact
2445	all he felt was incredulity and pride
2446	he was glad that this was happening but he had no physical desire
2447	it was too soon her youth and prettiness had frightened him he was too much used to living without womenhe did not know the reason
2448	the girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair
2449	she sat against him putting her arm round his waist
2450	never mind dear
2451	theres no hurry
2452	weve got the whole afternoon
2453	isnt this a splendid hideout
2454	i found it when i got lost once on a community hike
2455	if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away
2456	what is your name
2457	said winston
2458	julia
2459	i know yours
2460	its winstonwinston smith
2461	how did you find that out
2462	i expect im better at finding things out than you are dear
2463	tell me what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note
2464	he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her
2465	it was even a sort of loveoffering to start off by telling the worst
2466	i hated the sight of you he said
2467	i wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards
2468	two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone
2469	if you really want to know i imagined that you had something to do with the thought police
2470	the girl laughed delightedly evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise
2471	not the thought police
2472	you didnt honestly think that
2473	well perhaps not exactly that
2474	but from your general appearancemerely because youre young and fresh and healthy you understandi thought that probably
2475	you thought i was a good party member
2476	pure in word and deed
2477	banners processions slogans games community hikes all that stuff
2478	and you thought that if i had a quarter of a chance id denounce you as a thoughtcriminal and get you killed off
2479	yes something of that kind
2480	a great many young girls are like that you know
2481	its this bloody thing that does it she said ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior antisex league and flinging it on to a bough
2482	then as though touching her waist had reminded her of something she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate
2483	she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston
2484	even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate
2485	it was dark and shiny and was wrapped in silver paper
2486	chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted as nearly as one could describe it like the smoke of a rubbish fire
2487	but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him
2488	the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down but which was powerful and troubling
2489	where did you get this stuff
2490	he said
2491	black market she said indifferently
2492	actually i am that sort of girl to look at
2493	im good at games
2494	i was a troopleader in the spies
2495	i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior antisex league
2496	hours and hours ive spent pasting their bloody rot all over london
2497	i always carry one end of a banner in the processions
2498	i always look cheerful and i never shirk anything
2499	always yell with the crowd thats what i say
2500	its the only way to be safe
2501	the first fragment of chocolate had melted on winstons tongue
2502	the taste was delightful
2503	but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape like an object seen out of the corner of ones eye
2504	he pushed it away from him aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not
2505	you are very young he said
2506	you are ten or fifteen years younger than i am
2507	what could you see to attract you in a man like me
2508	it was something in your face
2509	i thought id take a chance
2510	im good at spotting people who dont belong
2511	as soon as i saw you i knew you were against them
2512	them it appeared meant the party and above all the inner party about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere
2513	a thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language
2514	party members were supposed not to swear and winston himself very seldom did swear aloud at any rate
2515	julia however seemed unable to mention the party and especially the inner party without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways
2516	he did not dislike it
2517	it was merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its ways and somehow it seemed natural and healthy like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay
2518	they had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade with their arms round each others waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast
2519	he noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone
2520	they did not speak above a whisper
2521	outside the clearing julia said it was better to go quietly
2522	presently they had reached the edge of the little wood
2523	she stopped him
2524	dont go out into the open
2525	there might be someone watching
2526	were all right if we keep behind the boughs
2527	they were standing in the shade of hazel bushes
2528	the sunlight filtering through innumerable leaves was still hot on their faces
2529	winston looked out into the field beyond and underwent a curious slow shock of recognition
2530	he knew it by sight
2531	an old closebitten pasture with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there
2532	in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like womens hair
2533	surely somewhere nearby but out of sight there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming
2534	isnt there a stream somewhere near here
2535	he whispered
2536	thats right there is a stream
2537	its at the edge of the next field actually
2538	there are fish in it great big ones
2539	you can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees waving their tails
2540	its the golden countryalmost he murmured
2541	the golden country
2542	its nothing really
2543	a landscape ive seen sometimes in a dream
2544	look
2545	whispered julia
2546	a thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away almost at the level of their faces
2547	perhaps it had not seen them
2548	it was in the sun they in the shade
2549	it spread out its wings fitted them carefully into place again ducked its head for a moment as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun and then began to pour forth a torrent of song
2550	in the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling
2551	winston and julia clung together fascinated
2552	the music went on and on minute after minute with astonishing variations never once repeating itself almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity
2553	sometimes it stopped for a few seconds spread out and resettled its wings then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song
2554	winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence
2555	for whom for what was that bird singing
2556	no mate no rival was watching it
2557	what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness
2558	he wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near
2559	he and julia had spoken only in low whispers and it would not pick up what they had said but it would pick up the thrush
2560	perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small beetlelike man was listening intentlylistening to that
2561	but by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind
2562	it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves
2563	he stopped thinking and merely felt
2564	the girls waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm
2565	he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast her body seemed to melt into his
2566	wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water
2567	their mouths clung together it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier
2568	when they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply
2569	the bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings
2570	winston put his lips against her ear
2571	now he whispered
2572	not here she whispered back
2573	come back to the hideout
2574	its safer
2575	quickly with an occasional crackle of twigs they threaded their way back to the clearing
2576	when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him
2577	they were both breathing fast but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth
2578	she stood looking at him for an instant then felt at the zipper of her overalls
2579	and yes
2580	it was almost as in his dream
2581	almost as swiftly as he had imagined it she had torn her clothes off and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated
2582	her body gleamed white in the sun
2583	but for a moment he did not look at her body his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint bold smile
2584	he knelt down before her and took her hands in his
2585	have you done this before
2586	of course
2587	hundreds of timeswell scores of times anyway
2588	with party members
2589	yes always with party members
2590	with members of the inner party
2591	not with those swine no
2592	but theres plenty that would if they got half a chance
2593	theyre not so holy as they make out
2594	his heart leapt
2595	scores of times she had done it he wished it had been hundredsthousands
2596	anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope
2597	who knew perhaps the party was rotten under the surface its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity
2598	if he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis how gladly he would have done so
2599	anything to rot to weaken to undermine
2600	he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face
2601	listen
2602	the more men youve had the more i love you
2603	do you understand that
2604	yes perfectly
2605	i hate purity i hate goodness
2606	i dont want any virtue to exist anywhere
2607	i want everyone to be corrupt to the bones
2608	well then i ought to suit you dear
2609	im corrupt to the bones
2610	you like doing this
2611	i dont mean simply me i mean the thing in itself
2612	i adore it
2613	that was above all what he wanted to hear
2614	not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct the simple undifferentiated desire that was the force that would tear the party to pieces
2615	he pressed her down upon the grass among the fallen bluebells
2616	this time there was no difficulty
2617	presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart
2618	the sun seemed to have grown hotter
2619	they were both sleepy
2620	he reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her
2621	almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour
2622	winston woke first
2623	he sat up and watched the freckled face still peacefully asleep pillowed on the palm of her hand
2624	except for her mouth you could not call her beautiful
2625	there was a line or two round the eyes if you looked closely
2626	the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft
2627	it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived
2628	the young strong body now helpless in sleep awoke in him a pitying protecting feeling
2629	but the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree while the thrush was singing had not quite come back
2630	he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank
2631	in the old days he thought a man looked at a girls body and saw that it was desirable and that was the end of the story
2632	but you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays
2633	no emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred
2634	their embrace had been a battle the climax a victory
2635	it was a blow struck against the party
2636	it was a political act
2637	chapter
2638	we can come here once again said julia
2639	its generally safe to use any hideout twice
2640	but not for another month or two of course
2641	as soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed
2642	she became alert and businesslike put her clothes on knotted the scarlet sash about her waist and began arranging the details of the journey home
2643	it seemed natural to leave this to her
2644	she obviously had a practical cunning which winston lacked and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london stored away from innumerable community hikes
2645	the route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come and brought him out at a different railway station
2646	never go home the same way as you went out she said as though enunciating an important general principle
2647	she would leave first and winston was to wait half an hour before following her
2648	she had named a place where they could meet after work four evenings hence
2649	it was a street in one of the poorer quarters where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy
2650	she would be hanging about among the stalls pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewingthread
2651	if she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition
2652	but with luck in the middle of the crowd it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting
2653	and now i must go she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions
2654	im due back at nineteenthirty
2655	ive got to put in two hours for the junior antisex league handing out leaflets or something
2656	isnt it bloody
2657	give me a brushdown would you
2658	have i got any twigs in my hair
2659	are you sure
2660	then goodbye my love goodbye
2661	she flung herself into his arms kissed him almost violently and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise
2662	even now he had not found out her surname or her address
2663	however it made no difference for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication
2664	as it happened they never went back to the clearing in the wood
2665	during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love
2666	that was in another hidingplace known to julia the belfry of a ruinous church in an almostdeserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier
2667	it was a good hidingplace when once you got there but the getting there was very dangerous
2668	for the rest they could meet only in the streets in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time
2669	in the street it was usually possible to talk after a fashion
2670	as they drifted down the crowded pavements not quite abreast and never looking at one another they carried on a curious intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot then continued almost without introduction on the following day
2671	julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation which she called talking by instalments
2672	she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips
2673	just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss
2674	they were passing in silence down a sidestreet julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets when there was a deafening roar the earth heaved and the air darkened and winston found himself lying on his side bruised and terrified
2675	a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand
2676	suddenly he became aware of julias face a few centimetres from his own deathly white as white as chalk
2677	even her lips were white
2678	she was dead
2679	he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face
2680	but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips
2681	both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster
2682	there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead
2683	even if it had been less dangerous it would still have been difficult to find time to meet
2684	winstons working week was sixty hours julias was even longer and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide
2685	julia in any case seldom had an evening completely free
2686	she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations distributing literature for the junior antisex league preparing banners for hate week making collections for the savings campaign and suchlike activities
2687	it paid she said it was camouflage
2688	if you kept the small rules you could break the big ones
2689	she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the parttime munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members
2690	so one evening every week winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses in a draughty illlit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens
2691	when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up
2692	it was a blazing afternoon
2693	the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung
2694	they sat talking for hours on the dusty twiglittered floor one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming
2695	julia was twentysix years old
2696	she lived in a hostel with thirty other girls always in the stink of women
2697	how i hate women
2698	she said parenthetically and she worked as he had guessed on the novelwriting machines in the fiction department
2699	she enjoyed her work which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor
2700	she was not clever but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery
2701	she could describe the whole process of composing a novel from the general directive issued by the planning committee down to the final touchingup by the rewrite squad
2702	but she was not interested in the finished product
2703	she didnt much care for reading she said
2704	books were just a commodity that had to be produced like jam or bootlaces
2705	she had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight
2706	at school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running
2707	she had been a troopleader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior antisex league
2708	she had always borne an excellent character
2709	she had even an infallible mark of good reputation been picked out to work in pornosec the subsection of the fiction department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles
2710	it was nicknamed muck house by the people who worked in it she remarked
2711	there she had remained for a year helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like spanking stories or one night in a girls school to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal
2712	what are these books like
2713	said winston curiously
2714	oh ghastly rubbish
2715	theyre boring really
2716	they only have six plots but they swap them round a bit
2717	of course i was only on the kaleidoscopes
2718	i was never in the rewrite squad
2719	im not literary dearnot even enough for that
2720	he learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec except the heads of the departments were girls
2721	the theory was that men whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled
2722	they dont even like having married women there she added
2723	girls are always supposed to be so pure
2724	heres one who isnt anyway
2725	she had had her first loveaffair when she was sixteen with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest
2726	and a good job too said julia otherwise theyd have had my name out of him when he confessed
2727	since then there had been various others
2728	life as she saw it was quite simple
2729	you wanted a good time they meaning the party wanted to stop you having it you broke the rules as best you could
2730	she seemed to think it just as natural that they should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught
2731	she hated the party and said so in the crudest words but she made no general criticism of it
2732	except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine
2733	he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use
2734	she had never heard of the brotherhood and refused to believe in its existence
2735	any kind of organized revolt against the party which was bound to be a failure struck her as stupid
2736	the clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same
2737	he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the revolution knowing nothing else accepting the party as something unalterable like the sky not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it as a rabbit dodges a dog
2738	they did not discuss the possibility of getting married
2739	it was too remote to be worth thinking about
2740	no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine winstons wife could somehow have been got rid of
2741	it was hopeless even as a daydream
2742	what was she like your wife
2743	said julia
2744	she wasdo you know the newspeak word goodthinkful
2745	meaning naturally orthodox incapable of thinking a bad thought
2746	no i didnt know the word but i know the kind of person right enough
2747	he began telling her the story of his married life but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already
2748	she described to him almost as though she had seen or felt it the stiffening of katharines body as soon as he touched her the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength even when her arms were clasped tightly round him
2749	with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things katharine in any case had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one
2750	i could have stood it if it hadnt been for one thing he said
2751	he told her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week
2752	she hated it but nothing would make her stop doing it
2753	she used to call itbut youll never guess
2754	our duty to the party said julia promptly
2755	how did you know that
2756	ive been at school too dear
2757	sex talks once a month for the oversixteens
2758	and in the youth movement
2759	they rub it into you for years
2760	i dare say it works in a lot of cases
2761	but of course you can never tell people are such hypocrites
2762	she began to enlarge upon the subject
2763	with julia everything came back to her own sexuality
2764	as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness
2765	unlike winston she had grasped the inner meaning of the partys sexual puritanism
2766	it was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the partys control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible
2767	what was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria which was desirable because it could be transformed into warfever and leaderworship
2768	the way she put it was
2769	when you make love youre using up energy and afterwards you feel happy and dont give a damn for anything
2770	they cant bear you to feel like that
2771	they want you to be bursting with energy all the time
2772	all this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour
2773	if youre happy inside yourself why should you get excited about big brother and the threeyear plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rot
2774	that was very true he thought
2775	there was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy
2776	for how could the fear the hatred and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force
2777	the sex impulse was dangerous to the party and the party had turned it to account
2778	they had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood
2779	the family could not actually be abolished and indeed people were encouraged to be fond of their children in almost the oldfashioned way
2780	the children on the other hand were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations
2781	the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police
2782	it was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately
2783	abruptly his mind went back to katharine
2784	katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the thought police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions
2785	but what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon which had brought the sweat out on his forehead
2786	he began telling julia of something that had happened or rather had failed to happen on another sweltering summer afternoon eleven years ago
2787	it was three or four months after they were married
2788	they had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kent
2789	they had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes but they took a wrong turning and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry
2790	it was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres with boulders at the bottom
2791	there was nobody of whom they could ask the way
2792	as soon as she realized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy
2793	to be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrongdoing
2794	she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction
2795	but at this moment winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them
2796	one tuft was of two colours magenta and brickred apparently growing on the same root
2797	he had never seen anything of the kind before and he called to katharine to come and look at it
2798	look katharine
2799	look at those flowers
2800	that clump down near the bottom
2801	do you see theyre two different colours
2802	she had already turned to go but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment
2803	she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing
2804	he was standing a little behind her and he put his hand on her waist to steady her
2805	at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were
2806	there was not a human creature anywhere not a leaf stirring not even a bird awake
2807	in a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds
2808	it was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon
2809	the sun blazed down upon them the sweat tickled his face
2810	and the thought struck him
2811	why didnt you give her a good shove
2812	said julia
2813	i would have
2814	yes dear you would have
2815	i would if id been the same person then as i am now
2816	or perhaps i wouldim not certain
2817	are you sorry you didnt
2818	yes
2819	on the whole im sorry i didnt
2820	they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor
2821	he pulled her closer against him
2822	her head rested on his shoulder the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung
2823	she was very young he thought she still expected something from life she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing
2824	actually it would have made no difference he said
2825	then why are you sorry you didnt do it
2826	only because i prefer a positive to a negative
2827	in this game that were playing we cant win
2828	some kinds of failure are better than other kinds thats all
2829	he felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent
2830	she always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind
2831	she would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated
2832	in a way she realized that she herself was doomed that sooner or later the thought police would catch her and kill her but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose
2833	all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness
2834	she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness that the only victory lay in the far future long after you were dead that from the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse
2835	we are the dead he said
2836	were not dead yet said julia prosaically
2837	not physically
2838	six months a yearfive years conceivably
2839	i am afraid of death
2840	you are young so presumably youre more afraid of it than i am
2841	obviously we shall put it off as long as we can
2842	but it makes very little difference
2843	so long as human beings stay human death and life are the same thing
2844	oh rubbish
2845	which would you sooner sleep with me or a skeleton
2846	dont you enjoy being alive
2847	dont you like feeling this is me this is my hand this is my leg im real im solid im alive
2848	dont you like this
2849	she twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him
2850	he could feel her breasts ripe yet firm through her overalls
2851	her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his
2852	yes i like that he said
2853	then stop talking about dying
2854	and now listen dear weve got to fix up about the next time we meet
2855	we may as well go back to the place in the wood
2856	weve given it a good long rest
2857	but you must get there by a different way this time
2858	ive got it all planned out
2859	you take the trainbut look ill draw it out for you
2860	and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust and with a twig from a pigeons nest began drawing a map on the floor
2861	chapter
2862	winston looked round the shabby little room above mr charringtons shop
2863	beside the window the enormous bed was made up with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster
2864	the oldfashioned clock with the twelvehour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece
2865	in the corner on the gateleg table the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the halfdarkness
2866	in the fender was a battered tin oilstove a saucepan and two cups provided by mr charrington
2867	winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil
2868	he had brought an envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablets
2869	the clocks hands said seventeentwenty it was nineteentwenty really
2870	she was coming at nineteenthirty
2871	folly folly his heart kept saying conscious gratuitous suicidal folly
2872	of all the crimes that a party member could commit this one was the least possible to conceal
2873	actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table
2874	as he had foreseen mr charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room
2875	he was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him
2876	nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose of a loveaffair
2877	instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible
2878	privacy he said was a very valuable thing
2879	everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally
2880	and when they had such a place it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself
2881	he even seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so added that there were two entries to the house one of them through the back yard which gave on an alley
2882	under the window somebody was singing
2883	winston peeped out secure in the protection of the muslin curtain
2884	the june sun was still high in the sky and in the sunfilled court below a monstrous woman solid as a norman pillar with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line pegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized as babies diapers
2885	whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto
2886	it was only an opeless fancy
2887	it passed like an ipril dye
2888	but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred
2889	they ave stolen my eart awye
2890	the tune had been haunting london for weeks past
2891	it was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a subsection of the music department
2892	the words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator
2893	but the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound
2894	he could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones and the cries of the children in the street and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic and yet the room seemed curiously silent thanks to the absence of a telescreen
2895	folly folly folly
2896	he thought again
2897	it was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught
2898	but the temptation of having a hidingplace that was truly their own indoors and near at hand had been too much for both of them
2899	for some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings
2900	working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of hate week
2901	it was more than a month distant but the enormous complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody
2902	finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day
2903	they had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood
2904	on the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street
2905	as usual winston hardly looked at julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual
2906	its all off she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak
2907	tomorrow i mean
2908	what
2909	tomorrow afternoon
2910	i cant come
2911	why not
2912	oh the usual reason
2913	its started early this time
2914	for a moment he was violently angry
2915	during the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed
2916	at the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it
2917	their first lovemaking had been simply an act of the will
2918	but after the second time it was different
2919	the smell of her hair the taste of her mouth the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him or into the air all round him
2920	she had become a physical necessity something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to
2921	when she said that she could not come he had the feeling that she was cheating him
2922	but just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met
2923	she gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection
2924	it struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal recurring event and a deep tenderness such as he had not felt for her before suddenly took hold of him
2925	he wished that they were a married couple of ten years standing
2926	he wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household
2927	he wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met
2928	it was not actually at that moment but at some time on the following day that the idea of renting mr charringtons room had occurred to him
2929	when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness
2930	both of them knew that it was lunacy
2931	it was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves
2932	as he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love
2933	it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of ones consciousness
2934	there it lay fixed in future times preceding death as surely as precedes
2935	one could not avoid it but one could perhaps postpone it and yet instead every now and again by a conscious wilful act one chose to shorten the interval before it happened
2936	at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs
2937	julia burst into the room
2938	she was carrying a toolbag of coarse brown canvas such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry
2939	he started forward to take her in his arms but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly partly because she was still holding the toolbag
2940	half a second she said
2941	just let me show you what ive brought
2942	did you bring some of that filthy victory coffee
2943	i thought you would
2944	you can chuck it away again because we shant be needing it
2945	look here
2946	she fell on her knees threw open the bag and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it
2947	underneath were a number of neat paper packets
2948	the first packet that she passed to winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling
2949	it was filled with some kind of heavy sandlike stuff which yielded wherever you touched it
2950	it isnt sugar
2951	he said
2952	real sugar
2953	not saccharine sugar
2954	and heres a loaf of breadproper white bread not our bloody stuffand a little pot of jam
2955	and heres a tin of milkbut look
2956	this is the one im really proud of
2957	i had to wrap a bit of sacking round it because
2958	but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up
2959	the smell was already filling the room a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood but which one did occasionally meet with even now blowing down a passageway before a door slammed or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street sniffed for an instant and then lost again
2960	its coffee he murmured real coffee
2961	its inner party coffee
2962	theres a whole kilo here she said
2963	how did you manage to get hold of all these things
2964	its all inner party stuff
2965	theres nothing those swine dont have nothing
2966	but of course waiters and servants and people pinch things andlook i got a little packet of tea as well
2967	winston had squatted down beside her
2968	he tore open a corner of the packet
2969	its real tea
2970	not blackberry leaves
2971	theres been a lot of tea about lately
2972	theyve captured india or something she said vaguely
2973	but listen dear
2974	i want you to turn your back on me for three minutes
2975	go and sit on the other side of the bed
2976	dont go too near the window
2977	and dont turn round till i tell you
2978	winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain
2979	down in the yard the redarmed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line
2980	she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling
2981	they sye that time eals all things
2982	they sye you can always forget
2983	but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years
2984	they twist my eartstrings yet
2985	she knew the whole drivelling song by heart it seemed
2986	her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air very tuneful charged with a sort of happy melancholy
2987	one had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible to remain there for a thousand years pegging out diapers and singing rubbish
2988	it struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously
2989	it would even have seemed slightly unorthodox a dangerous eccentricity like talking to oneself
2990	perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about
2991	you can turn round now said julia
2992	he turned round and for a second almost failed to recognize her
2993	what he had actually expected was to see her naked
2994	but she was not naked
2995	the transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that
2996	she had painted her face
2997	she must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of makeup materials
2998	her lips were deeply reddened her cheeks rouged her nose powdered there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter
2999	it was not very skilfully done but winstons standards in such matters were not high
3000	he had never before seen or imagined a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face
3001	the improvement in her appearance was startling
3002	with just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier but above all far more feminine
3003	her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect
3004	as he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils
3005	he remembered the halfdarkness of a basement kitchen and a womans cavernous mouth
3006	it was the very same scent that she had used but at the moment it did not seem to matter
3007	scent too
3008	he said
3009	yes dear scent too
3010	and do you know what im going to do next
3011	im going to get hold of a real womans frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers
3012	ill wear silk stockings and highheeled shoes
3013	in this room im going to be a woman not a party comrade
3014	they flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed
3015	it was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence
3016	until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle
3017	there were no sheets but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them
3018	its sure to be full of bugs but who cares
3019	said julia
3020	one never saw a double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proles
3021	winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood julia had never been in one before so far as she could remember
3022	presently they fell asleep for a little while
3023	when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine
3024	he did not stir because julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm
3025	most of her makeup had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone
3026	a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace where the water in the pan was boiling fast
3027	down in the yard the woman had stopped singing but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street
3028	he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this in the cool of a summer evening a man and a woman with no clothes on making love when they chose talking of what they chose not feeling any compulsion to get up simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside
3029	surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary
3030	julia woke up rubbed her eyes and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove
3031	half that waters boiled away she said
3032	ill get up and make some coffee in another moment
3033	weve got an hour
3034	what time do they cut the lights off at your flats
3035	twentythree thirty
3036	its twentythree at the hostel
3037	but you have to get in earlier than that becausehi
3038	get out you filthy brute
3039	she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed seized a shoe from the floor and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein that morning during the two minutes hate
3040	what was it
3041	he said in surprise
3042	a rat
3043	i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting
3044	theres a hole down there
3045	i gave him a good fright anyway
3046	rats
3047	murmured winston
3048	in this room
3049	theyre all over the place said julia indifferently as she lay down again
3050	weve even got them in the kitchen at the hostel
3051	some parts of london are swarming with them
3052	did you know they attack children
3053	yes they do
3054	in some of these streets a woman darent leave a baby alone for two minutes
3055	its the great huge brown ones that do it
3056	and the nasty thing is that the brutes always
3057	dont go on
3058	said winston with his eyes tightly shut
3059	dearest
3060	youve gone quite pale
3061	whats the matter
3062	do they make you feel sick
3063	of all horrors in the worlda rat
3064	she pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body
3065	he did not reopen his eyes immediately
3066	for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life
3067	it was always very much the same
3068	he was standing in front of a wall of darkness and on the other side of it there was something unendurable something too dreadful to be faced
3069	in the dream his deepest feeling was always one of selfdeception because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness
3070	with a deadly effort like wrenching a piece out of his own brain he could even have dragged the thing into the open
3071	he always woke up without discovering what it was but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut her short
3072	im sorry he said its nothing
3073	i dont like rats thats all
3074	dont worry dear were not going to have the filthy brutes in here
3075	ill stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go
3076	and next time we come here ill bring some plaster and bung it up properly
3077	already the black instant of panic was halfforgotten
3078	feeling slightly ashamed of himself he sat up against the bedhead
3079	julia got out of bed pulled on her overalls and made the coffee
3080	the smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive
3081	what was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine
3082	with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other julia wandered about the room glancing indifferently at the bookcase pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table plumping herself down in the ragged armchair to see if it was comfortable and examining the absurd twelvehour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement
3083	she brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light
3084	he took it out of her hand fascinated as always by the soft rainwatery appearance of the glass
3085	what is it do you think
3086	said julia
3087	i dont think its anythingi mean i dont think it was ever put to any use
3088	thats what i like about it
3089	its a little chunk of history that theyve forgotten to alter
3090	its a message from a hundred years ago if one knew how to read it
3091	and that picture over thereshe nodded at the engraving on the opposite wallwould that be a hundred years old
3092	more
3093	two hundred i dare say
3094	one cant tell
3095	its impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays
3096	she went over to look at it
3097	heres where that brute stuck his nose out she said kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture
3098	what is this place
3099	ive seen it before somewhere
3100	its a church or at least it used to be
3101	st clement danes its name was
3102	the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back into his head and he added halfnostalgically oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
3103	to his astonishment she capped the line
3104	you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins
3105	when will you pay me
3106	say the bells of old bailey
3107	i cant remember how it goes on after that
3108	but anyway i remember it ends up here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head
3109	it was like the two halves of a countersign
3110	but there must be another line after the bells of old bailey
3111	perhaps it could be dug out of mr charringtons memory if he were suitably prompted
3112	who taught you that
3113	he said
3114	my grandfather
3115	he used to say it to me when i was a little girl
3116	he was vaporized when i was eightat any rate he disappeared
3117	i wonder what a lemon was she added inconsequently
3118	ive seen oranges
3119	theyre a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin
3120	i can remember lemons said winston
3121	they were quite common in the fifties
3122	they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them
3123	i bet that pictures got bugs behind it said julia
3124	ill take it down and give it a good clean some day
3125	i suppose its almost time we were leaving
3126	i must start washing this paint off
3127	what a bore
3128	ill get the lipstick off your face afterwards
3129	winston did not get up for a few minutes more
3130	the room was darkening
3131	he turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight
3132	the inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself
3133	there was such a depth of it and yet it was almost as transparent as air
3134	it was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete
3135	he had the feeling that he could get inside it and that in fact he was inside it along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself
3136	the paperweight was the room he was in and the coral was julias life and his own fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal
3137	chapter
3138	syme had vanished
3139	a morning came and he was missing from work a few thoughtless people commented on his absence
3140	on the next day nobody mentioned him
3141	on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the records department to look at the noticeboard
3142	one of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the chess committee of whom syme had been one
3143	it looked almost exactly as it had looked beforenothing had been crossed outbut it was one name shorter
3144	it was enough
3145	syme had ceased to exist he had never existed
3146	the weather was baking hot
3147	in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless airconditioned rooms kept their normal temperature but outside the pavements scorched ones feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours was a horror
3148	the preparations for hate week were in full swing and the staffs of all the ministries were working overtime
3149	processions meetings military parades lectures waxworks displays film shows telescreen programmes all had to be organized stands had to be erected effigies built slogans coined songs written rumours circulated photographs faked
3150	julias unit in the fiction department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets
3151	winston in addition to his regular work spent long periods every day in going through back files of the times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches
3152	late at night when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets the town had a curiously febrile air
3153	the rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours
3154	the new tune which was to be the themesong of hate week the hate song it was called had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens
3155	it had a savage barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music but resembled the beating of a drum
3156	roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet it was terrifying
3157	the proles had taken a fancy to it and in the midnight streets it competed with the stillpopular it was only a hopeless fancy
3158	the parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day unbearably on a comb and a piece of toilet paper
3159	winstons evenings were fuller than ever
3160	squads of volunteers organized by parsons were preparing the street for hate week stitching banners painting posters erecting flagstaffs on the roofs and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers
3161	parsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting
3162	he was in his native element and as happy as a lark
3163	the heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings
3164	he was everywhere at once pushing pulling sawing hammering improvising jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acridsmelling sweat
3165	a new poster had suddenly appeared all over london
3166	it had no caption and represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier three or four metres high striding forward with expressionless mongolian face and enormous boots a submachine gun pointed from his hip
3167	from whatever angle you looked at the poster the muzzle of the gun magnified by the foreshortening seemed to be pointed straight at you
3168	the thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall even outnumbering the portraits of big brother
3169	the proles normally apathetic about the war were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism
3170	as though to harmonize with the general mood the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual
3171	one fell on a crowded film theatre in stepney burying several hundred victims among the ruins
3172	the whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting
3173	another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces
3174	there were further angry demonstrations goldstein was burned in effigy hundreds of copies of the poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation
3175	in the room over mr charringtons shop when they could get there julia and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window naked for the sake of coolness
3176	the rat had never come back but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat
3177	it did not seem to matter
3178	dirty or clean the room was paradise
3179	as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market tear off their clothes and make love with sweating bodies then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counterattack
3180	four five sixseven times they met during the month of june
3181	winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours
3182	he seemed to have lost the need for it
3183	he had grown fatter his varicose ulcer had subsided leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped
3184	the process of life had ceased to be intolerable he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice
3185	now that they had a secure hidingplace almost a home it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time
3186	what mattered was that the room over the junkshop should exist
3187	to know that it was there inviolate was almost the same as being in it
3188	the room was a world a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk
3189	mr charrington thought winston was another extinct animal
3190	he usually stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs
3191	the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors and on the other hand to have almost no customers
3192	he led a ghostlike existence between the tiny dark shop and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained among other things an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn
3193	he seemed glad of the opportunity to talk
3194	wandering about among his worthless stock with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman
3195	with a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or thata china bottlestopper the painted lid of a broken snuffbox a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some longdead babys hairnever asking that winston should buy it merely that he should admire it
3196	to talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a wornout musicalbox
3197	he had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes
3198	there was one about four and twenty blackbirds and another about a cow with a crumpled horn and another about the death of poor cock robin
3199	it just occurred to me you might be interested he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment
3200	but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme
3201	both of them knewin a way it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long
3202	there were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking
3203	but there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence
3204	so long as they were actually in this room they both felt no harm could come to them
3205	getting there was difficult and dangerous but the room itself was sanctuary
3206	it was as when winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world and that once inside it time could be arrested
3207	often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape
3208	their luck would hold indefinitely and they would carry on their intrigue just like this for the remainder of their natural lives
3209	or katharine would die and by subtle manoeuvrings winston and julia would succeed in getting married
3210	or they would commit suicide together
3211	or they would disappear alter themselves out of recognition learn to speak with proletarian accents get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a backstreet
3212	it was all nonsense as they both knew
3213	in reality there was no escape
3214	even the one plan that was practicable suicide they had no intention of carrying out
3215	to hang on from day to day and from week to week spinning out a present that had no future seemed an unconquerable instinct just as ones lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available
3216	sometimes too they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the party but with no notion of how to take the first step
3217	even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality there still remained the difficulty of finding ones way into it
3218	he told her of the strange intimacy that existed or seemed to exist between himself and obrien and of the impulse he sometimes felt simply to walk into obriens presence announce that he was the enemy of the party and demand his help
3219	curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do
3220	she was used to judging people by their faces and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe obrien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes
3221	moreover she took it for granted that everyone or nearly everyone secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so
3222	but she refused to believe that widespread organized opposition existed or could exist
3223	the tales about goldstein and his underground army she said were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in
3224	times beyond number at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief
3225	when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night chanting at intervals death to the traitors
3226	during the two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at goldstein
3227	yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent
3228	she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties
3229	such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination and in any case the party was invincible
3230	it would always exist and it would always be the same
3231	you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or at most by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up
3232	in some ways she was far more acute than winston and far less susceptible to party propaganda
3233	once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against eurasia she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening
3234	the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fired by the government of oceania itself just to keep people frightened
3235	this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him
3236	she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing
3237	but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life
3238	often she was ready to accept the official mythology simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her
3239	she believed for instance having learnt it at school that the party had invented aeroplanes
3240	in his own schooldays winston remembered in the late fifties it was only the helicopter that the party claimed to have invented a dozen years later when julia was at school it was already claiming the aeroplane one generation more and it would be claiming the steam engine
3241	and when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution the fact struck her as totally uninteresting
3242	after all what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes
3243	it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania four years ago had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia
3244	it was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed
3245	i thought wed always been at war with eurasia she said vaguely
3246	it frightened him a little
3247	the invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago well after she was grown up
3248	he argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour
3249	in the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy
3250	but the issue still struck her as unimportant
3251	who cares
3252	she said impatiently
3253	its always one bloody war after another and one knows the news is all lies anyway
3254	sometimes he talked to her of the records department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there
3255	such things did not appear to horrify her
3256	she did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths
3257	he told her the story of jones aaronson and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers
3258	it did not make much impression on her
3259	at first indeed she failed to grasp the point of the story
3260	were they friends of yours
3261	she said
3262	no i never knew them
3263	they were inner party members
3264	besides they were far older men than i was
3265	they belonged to the old days before the revolution
3266	i barely knew them by sight
3267	then what was there to worry about
3268	people are being killed off all the time arent they
3269	he tried to make her understand
3270	this was an exceptional case
3271	it wasnt just a question of somebody being killed
3272	do you realize that the past starting from yesterday has been actually abolished
3273	if it survives anywhere its in a few solid objects with no words attached to them like that lump of glass there
3274	already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years before the revolution
3275	every record has been destroyed or falsified every book has been rewritten every picture has been repainted every statue and street and building has been renamed every date has been altered
3276	and that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute
3277	history has stopped
3278	nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right
3279	i know of course that the past is falsified but it would never be possible for me to prove it even when i did the falsification myself
3280	after the thing is done no evidence ever remains
3281	the only evidence is inside my own mind and i dont know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories
3282	just in that one instance in my whole life i did possess actual concrete evidence after the eventyears after it
3283	and what good was that
3284	it was no good because i threw it away a few minutes later
3285	but if the same thing happened today i should keep it
3286	well i wouldnt
3287	said julia
3288	im quite ready to take risks but only for something worth while not for bits of old newspaper
3289	what could you have done with it even if you had kept it
3290	not much perhaps
3291	but it was evidence
3292	it might have planted a few doubts here and there supposing that id dared to show it to anybody
3293	i dont imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime
3294	but one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and theresmall groups of people banding themselves together and gradually growing and even leaving a few records behind so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off
3295	im not interested in the next generation dear
3296	im interested in us
3297	youre only a rebel from the waist downwards he told her
3298	she thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight
3299	in the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest
3300	whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc doublethink the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality and to use newspeak words she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing
3301	one knew that it was all rubbish so why let oneself be worried by it
3302	she knew when to cheer and when to boo and that was all one needed
3303	if he persisted in talking of such subjects she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep
3304	she was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position
3305	talking to her he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant
3306	in a way the worldview of the party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it
3307	they could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening
3308	by lack of understanding they remained sane
3309	they simply swallowed everything and what they swallowed did them no harm because it left no residue behind just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird
3310	chapter
3311	it had happened at last
3312	the expected message had come
3313	all his life it seemed to him he had been waiting for this to happen
3314	he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry and he was almost at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him
3315	the person whoever it was gave a small cough evidently as a prelude to speaking
3316	winston stopped abruptly and turned
3317	it was obrien
3318	at last they were face to face and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away
3319	his heart bounded violently
3320	he would have been incapable of speaking
3321	obrien however had continued forward in the same movement laying a friendly hand for a moment on winstons arm so that the two of them were walking side by side
3322	he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party members
3323	i had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you he said
3324	i was reading one of your newspeak articles in the times the other day
3325	you take a scholarly interest in newspeak i believe
3326	winston had recovered part of his selfpossession
3327	hardly scholarly he said
3328	im only an amateur
3329	its not my subject
3330	i have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language
3331	but you write it very elegantly said obrien
3332	that is not only my own opinion
3333	i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert
3334	his name has slipped my memory for the moment
3335	again winstons heart stirred painfully
3336	it was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to syme
3337	but syme was not only dead he was abolished an unperson
3338	any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous
3339	obriens remark must obviously have been intended as a signal a codeword
3340	by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices
3341	they had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor but now obrien halted
3342	with the curious disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose
3343	then he went on
3344	what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete
3345	but they have only become so very recently
3346	have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary
3347	no said winston
3348	i didnt think it had been issued yet
3349	we are still using the ninth in the records department
3350	the tenth edition is not due to appear for some months i believe
3351	but a few advance copies have been circulated
3352	i have one myself
3353	it might interest you to look at it perhaps
3354	very much so said winston immediately seeing where this tended
3355	some of the new developments are most ingenious
3356	the reduction in the number of verbsthat is the point that will appeal to you i think
3357	let me see shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary
3358	but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind
3359	perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you
3360	wait
3361	let me give you my address
3362	they were standing in front of a telescreen
3363	somewhat absentmindedly obrien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leathercovered notebook and a gold inkpencil
3364	immediately beneath the telescreen in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing he scribbled an address tore out the page and handed it to winston
3365	i am usually at home in the evenings he said
3366	if not my servant will give you the dictionary
3367	he was gone leaving winston holding the scrap of paper which this time there was no need to conceal
3368	nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers
3369	they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most
3370	there was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have
3371	it had been contrived as a way of letting winston know obriens address
3372	this was necessary because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived
3373	there were no directories of any kind
3374	if you ever want to see me this is where i can be found was what obrien had been saying to him
3375	perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary
3376	but at any rate one thing was certain
3377	the conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist and he had reached the outer edges of it
3378	he knew that sooner or later he would obey obriens summons
3379	perhaps tomorrow perhaps after a long delayhe was not certain
3380	what was happening was only the workingout of a process that had started years ago
3381	the first step had been a secret involuntary thought the second had been the opening of the diary
3382	he had moved from thoughts to words and now from words to actions
3383	the last step was something that would happen in the ministry of love
3384	he had accepted it
3385	the end was contained in the beginning
3386	but it was frightening or more exactly it was like a foretaste of death like being a little less alive
3387	even while he was speaking to obrien when the meaning of the words had sunk in a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body
3388	he had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him
3389	chapter
3390	winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears
3391	julia rolled sleepily against him murmuring something that might have been whats the matter
3392	i dreamt he began and stopped short
3393	it was too complex to be put into words
3394	there was the dream itself and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking
3395	he lay back with his eyes shut still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream
3396	it was a vast luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain
3397	it had all occurred inside the glass paperweight but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances
3398	the dream had also been comprehended byindeed in some sense it had consisted ina gesture of the arm made by his mother and made again thirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news film trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets before the helicopter blew them both to pieces
3399	do you know he said that until this moment i believed i had murdered my mother
3400	why did you murder her
3401	said julia almost asleep
3402	i didnt murder her
3403	not physically
3404	in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back
3405	it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years
3406	he was not certain of the date but he could not have been less than ten years old possibly twelve when it had happened
3407	his father had disappeared some time earlier how much earlier he could not remember
3408	he remembered better the rackety uneasy circumstances of the time the periodical panics about airraids and the sheltering in tube stations the piles of rubble everywhere the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour the enormous queues outside the bakeries the intermittent machinegun fire in the distanceabove all the fact that there was never enough to eat
3409	he remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves potato peelings sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed and which when they jolted over the bad patches in the road sometimes spilt a few fragments of oilcake
3410	when his father disappeared his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief but a sudden change came over her
3411	she seemed to have become completely spiritless
3412	it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen
3413	she did everything that was neededcooked washed mended made the bed swept the floor dusted the mantelpiecealways very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion like an artists layfigure moving of its own accord
3414	her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness
3415	for hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed nursing his young sister a tiny ailing very silent child of two or three with a face made simian by thinness
3416	very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything
3417	he was aware in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness that this was somehow connected with the nevermentioned thing that was about to happen
3418	he remembered the room where they lived a dark closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane
3419	there was a gas ring in the fender and a shelf where food was kept and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink common to several rooms
3420	he remembered his mothers statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan
3421	above all he remembered his continuous hunger and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes
3422	he would ask his mother naggingly over and over again why there was not more food he would shout and storm at her he even remembered the tones of his voice which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share
3423	his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share
3424	she took it for granted that he the boy should have the biggest portion but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more
3425	at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food but it was no use
3426	he would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands he would grab bits from his sisters plate
3427	he knew that he was starving the other two but he could not help it he even felt that he had a right to do it
3428	the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him
3429	between meals if his mother did not stand guard he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf
3430	one day a chocolate ration was issued
3431	there had been no such issue for weeks or months past
3432	he remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate
3433	it was a twoounce slab they still talked about ounces in those days between the three of them
3434	it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts
3435	suddenly as though he were listening to somebody else winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece
3436	his mother told him not to be greedy
3437	there was a long nagging argument that went round and round with shouts whines tears remonstrances bargainings
3438	his tiny sister clinging to her mother with both hands exactly like a baby monkey sat looking over her shoulder at him with large mournful eyes
3439	in the end his mother broke off threequarters of the chocolate and gave it to winston giving the other quarter to his sister
3440	the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully perhaps not knowing what it was
3441	winston stood watching her for a moment
3442	then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sisters hand and was fleeing for the door
3443	winston winston
3444	his mother called after him
3445	come back
3446	give your sister back her chocolate
3447	he stopped but did not come back
3448	his mothers anxious eyes were fixed on his face
3449	even now he was thinking about the thing he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening
3450	his sister conscious of having been robbed of something had set up a feeble wail
3451	his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast
3452	something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying
3453	he turned and fled down the stairs with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand
3454	he never saw his mother again
3455	after he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours until hunger drove him home
3456	when he came back his mother had disappeared
3457	this was already becoming normal at that time
3458	nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister
3459	they had not taken any clothes not even his mothers overcoat
3460	to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead
3461	it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forcedlabour camp
3462	as for his sister she might have been removed like winston himself to one of the colonies for homeless children reclamation centres they were called which had grown up as a result of the civil war or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother or simply left somewhere or other to die
3463	the dream was still vivid in his mind especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained
3464	his mind went back to another dream of two months ago
3465	exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed with the child clinging to her so she had sat in the sunken ship far underneath him and drowning deeper every minute but still looking up at him through the darkening water
3466	he told julia the story of his mothers disappearance
3467	without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position
3468	i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days she said indistinctly
3469	all children are swine
3470	yes
3471	but the real point of the story
3472	from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again
3473	he would have liked to continue talking about his mother
3474	he did not suppose from what he could remember of her that she had been an unusual woman still less an intelligent one and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility a kind of purity simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones
3475	her feelings were her own and could not be altered from outside
3476	it would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless
3477	if you loved someone you loved him and when you had nothing else to give you still gave him love
3478	when the last of the chocolate was gone his mother had clasped the child in her arms
3479	it was no use it changed nothing it did not produce more chocolate it did not avert the childs death or her own but it seemed natural to her to do it
3480	the refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper
3481	the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses mere feelings were of no account while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world
3482	when once you were in the grip of the party what you felt or did not feel what you did or refrained from doing made literally no difference
3483	whatever happened you vanished and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again
3484	you were lifted clean out of the stream of history
3485	and yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed allimportant because they were not attempting to alter history
3486	they were governed by private loyalties which they did not question
3487	what mattered were individual relationships and a completely helpless gesture an embrace a tear a word spoken to a dying man could have value in itself
3488	the proles it suddenly occurred to him had remained in this condition
3489	they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea they were loyal to one another
3490	for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world
3491	the proles had stayed human
3492	they had not become hardened inside
3493	they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious effort
3494	and in thinking this he remembered without apparent relevance how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbagestalk
3495	the proles are human beings he said aloud
3496	we are not human
3497	why not
3498	said julia who had woken up again
3499	he thought for a little while
3500	has it ever occurred to you he said that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before its too late and never see each other again
3501	yes dear it has occurred to me several times
3502	but im not going to do it all the same
3503	weve been lucky he said but it cant last much longer
3504	youre young
3505	you look normal and innocent
3506	if you keep clear of people like me you might stay alive for another fifty years
3507	no
3508	ive thought it all out
3509	what you do im going to do
3510	and dont be too downhearted
3511	im rather good at staying alive
3512	we may be together for another six monthsa yeartheres no knowing
3513	at the end were certain to be apart
3514	do you realize how utterly alone we shall be
3515	when once they get hold of us there will be nothing literally nothing that either of us can do for the other
3516	if i confess theyll shoot you and if i refuse to confess theyll shoot you just the same
3517	nothing that i can do or say or stop myself from saying will put off your death for as much as five minutes
3518	neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead
3519	we shall be utterly without power of any kind
3520	the one thing that matters is that we shouldnt betray one another although even that cant make the slightest difference
3521	if you mean confessing she said we shall do that right enough
3522	everybody always confesses
3523	you cant help it
3524	they torture you
3525	i dont mean confessing
3526	confession is not betrayal
3527	what you say or do doesnt matter only feelings matter
3528	if they could make me stop loving youthat would be the real betrayal
3529	she thought it over
3530	they cant do that she said finally
3531	its the one thing they cant do
3532	they can make you say anythinganythingbut they cant make you believe it
3533	they cant get inside you
3534	no he said a little more hopefully no thats quite true
3535	they cant get inside you
3536	if you can feel that staying human is worth while even when it cant have any result whatever youve beaten them
3537	he thought of the telescreen with its neversleeping ear
3538	they could spy upon you night and day but if you kept your head you could still outwit them
3539	with all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking
3540	perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands
3541	one did not know what happened inside the ministry of love but it was possible to guess tortures drugs delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions gradual wearingdown by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning
3542	facts at any rate could not be kept hidden
3543	they could be tracked down by enquiry they could be squeezed out of you by torture
3544	but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human what difference did it ultimately make
3545	they could not alter your feelings for that matter you could not alter them yourself even if you wanted to
3546	they could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought but the inner heart whose workings were mysterious even to yourself remained impregnable
3547	chapter
3548	they had done it they had done it at last
3549	the room they were standing in was longshaped and softly lit
3550	the telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur the richness of the darkblue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet
3551	at the far end of the room obrien was sitting at a table under a greenshaded lamp with a mass of papers on either side of him
3552	he had not bothered to look up when the servant showed julia and winston in
3553	winstons heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak
3554	they had done it they had done it at last was all he could think
3555	it had been a rash act to come here at all and sheer folly to arrive together though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on obriens doorstep
3556	but merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve
3557	it was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwellingplaces of the inner party or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived
3558	the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats the richness and spaciousness of everything the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down the whitejacketed servants hurrying to and froeverything was intimidating
3559	although he had a good pretext for coming here he was haunted at every step by the fear that a blackuniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner demand his papers and order him to get out
3560	obriens servant however had admitted the two of them without demur
3561	he was a small darkhaired man in a white jacket with a diamondshaped completely expressionless face which might have been that of a chinese
3562	the passage down which he led them was softly carpeted with creampapered walls and white wainscoting all exquisitely clean
3563	that too was intimidating
3564	winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies
3565	obrien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently
3566	his heavy face bent down so that one could see the line of the nose looked both formidable and intelligent
3567	for perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring
3568	then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministries
3569	items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message
3570	he rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet
3571	a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the newspeak words but his expression was grimmer than usual as though he were not pleased at being disturbed
3572	the terror that winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment
3573	it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake
3574	for what evidence had he in reality that obrien was any kind of political conspirator
3575	nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark beyond that only his own secret imaginings founded on a dream
3576	he could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary because in that case julias presence was impossible to explain
3577	as obrien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him
3578	he stopped turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall
3579	there was a sharp snap
3580	the voice had stopped
3581	julia uttered a tiny sound a sort of squeak of surprise
3582	even in the midst of his panic winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue
3583	you can turn it off
3584	he said
3585	yes said obrien we can turn it off
3586	we have that privilege
3587	he was opposite them now
3588	his solid form towered over the pair of them and the expression on his face was still indecipherable
3589	he was waiting somewhat sternly for winston to speak but about what
3590	even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted
3591	nobody spoke
3592	after the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent
3593	the seconds marched past enormous
3594	with difficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on obriens
3595	then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile
3596	with his characteristic gesture obrien resettled his spectacles on his nose
3597	shall i say it or will you
3598	he said
3599	i will say it said winston promptly
3600	that thing is really turned off
3601	yes everything is turned off
3602	we are alone
3603	we have come here because
3604	he paused realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives
3605	since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from obrien it was not easy to say why he had come here
3606	he went on conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious
3607	we believe that there is some kind of conspiracy some kind of secret organization working against the party and that you are involved in it
3608	we want to join it and work for it
3609	we are enemies of the party
3610	we disbelieve in the principles of ingsoc
3611	we are thoughtcriminals
3612	we are also adulterers
3613	i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy
3614	if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way we are ready
3615	he stopped and glanced over his shoulder with the feeling that the door had opened
3616	sure enough the little yellowfaced servant had come in without knocking
3617	winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses
3618	martin is one of us said obrien impassively
3619	bring the drinks over here martin
3620	put them on the round table
3621	have we enough chairs
3622	then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort
3623	bring a chair for yourself martin
3624	this is business
3625	you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes
3626	the little man sat down quite at his ease and yet still with a servantlike air the air of a valet enjoying a privilege
3627	winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye
3628	it struck him that the mans whole life was playing a part and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment
3629	obrien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a darkred liquid
3630	it aroused in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoardinga vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass
3631	seen from the top the stuff looked almost black but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby
3632	it had a soursweet smell
3633	he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity
3634	it is called wine said obrien with a faint smile
3635	you will have read about it in books no doubt
3636	not much of it gets to the outer party i am afraid
3637	his face grew solemn again and he raised his glass i think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health
3638	to our leader to emmanuel goldstein
3639	winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness
3640	wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about
3641	like the glass paperweight or mr charringtons halfremembered rhymes it belonged to the vanished romantic past the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts
3642	for some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect
3643	actually when he came to swallow it the stuff was distinctly disappointing
3644	the truth was that after years of gindrinking he could barely taste it
3645	he set down the empty glass
3646	then there is such a person as goldstein
3647	he said
3648	yes there is such a person and he is alive
3649	where i do not know
3650	and the conspiracythe organization
3651	is it real
3652	it is not simply an invention of the thought police
3653	no it is real
3654	the brotherhood we call it
3655	you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it
3656	i will come back to that presently
3657	he looked at his wristwatch
3658	it is unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour
3659	you ought not to have come here together and you will have to leave separately
3660	you comradehe bowed his head to juliawill leave first
3661	we have about twenty minutes at our disposal
3662	you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions
3663	in general terms what are you prepared to do
3664	anything that we are capable of said winston
3665	obrien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing winston
3666	he almost ignored julia seeming to take it for granted that winston could speak for her
3667	for a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes
3668	he began asking his questions in a low expressionless voice as though this were a routine a sort of catechism most of whose answers were known to him already
3669	you are prepared to give your lives
3670	yes
3671	you are prepared to commit murder
3672	yes
3673	to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people
3674	yes
3675	to betray your country to foreign powers
3676	yes
3677	you are prepared to cheat to forge to blackmail to corrupt the minds of children to distribute habitforming drugs to encourage prostitution to disseminate venereal diseasesto do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party
3678	yes
3679	if for example it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a childs faceare you prepared to do that
3680	yes
3681	you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dockworker
3682	yes
3683	you are prepared to commit suicide if and when we order you to do so
3684	yes
3685	you are prepared the two of you to separate and never see one another again
3686	no
3687	broke in julia
3688	it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered
3689	for a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech
3690	his tongue worked soundlessly forming the opening syllables first of one word then of the other over and over again
3691	until he had said it he did not know which word he was going to say
3692	no he said finally
3693	you did well to tell me said obrien
3694	it is necessary for us to know everything
3695	he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it
3696	do you understand that even if he survives it may be as a different person
3697	we may be obliged to give him a new identity
3698	his face his movements the shape of his hands the colour of his haireven his voice would be different
3699	and you yourself might have become a different person
3700	our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition
3701	sometimes it is necessary
3702	sometimes we even amputate a limb
3703	winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martins mongolian face
3704	there were no scars that he could see
3705	julia had turned a shade paler so that her freckles were showing but she faced obrien boldly
3706	she murmured something that seemed to be assent
3707	good
3708	then that is settled
3709	there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table
3710	with a rather absentminded air obrien pushed them towards the others took one himself then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro as though he could think better standing
3711	they were very good cigarettes very thick and wellpacked with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper
3712	obrien looked at his wristwatch again
3713	you had better go back to your pantry martin he said
3714	i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour
3715	take a good look at these comrades faces before you go
3716	you will be seeing them again
3717	i may not
3718	exactly as they had done at the front door the little mans dark eyes flickered over their faces
3719	there was not a trace of friendliness in his manner
3720	he was memorizing their appearance but he felt no interest in them or appeared to feel none
3721	it occurred to winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression
3722	without speaking or giving any kind of salutation martin went out closing the door silently behind him
3723	obrien was strolling up and down one hand in the pocket of his black overalls the other holding his cigarette
3724	you understand he said that you will be fighting in the dark
3725	you will always be in the dark
3726	you will receive orders and you will obey them without knowing why
3727	later i shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in and the strategy by which we shall destroy it
3728	when you have read the book you will be full members of the brotherhood
3729	but between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment you will never know anything
3730	i tell you that the brotherhood exists but i cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members or ten million
3731	from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen
3732	you will have three or four contacts who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear
3733	as this was your first contact it will be preserved
3734	when you receive orders they will come from me
3735	if we find it necessary to communicate with you it will be through martin
3736	when you are finally caught you will confess
3737	that is unavoidable
3738	but you will have very little to confess other than your own actions
3739	you will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people
3740	probably you will not even betray me
3741	by that time i may be dead or i shall have become a different person with a different face
3742	he continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet
3743	in spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements
3744	it came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket or manipulated a cigarette
3745	more even than of strength he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony
3746	however much in earnest he might be he had nothing of the singlemindedness that belongs to a fanatic
3747	when he spoke of murder suicide venereal disease amputated limbs and altered faces it was with a faint air of persiflage
3748	this is unavoidable his voice seemed to say this is what we have got to do unflinchingly
3749	but this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again
3750	a wave of admiration almost of worship flowed out from winston towards obrien
3751	for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein
3752	when you looked at obriens powerful shoulders and his bluntfeatured face so ugly and yet so civilized it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated
3753	there was no stratagem that he was not equal to no danger that he could not foresee
3754	even julia seemed to be impressed
3755	she had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently
3756	obrien went on
3757	you will have heard rumours of the existence of the brotherhood
3758	no doubt you have formed your own picture of it
3759	you have imagined probably a huge underworld of conspirators meeting secretly in cellars scribbling messages on walls recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand
3760	nothing of the kind exists
3761	the members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others
3762	goldstein himself if he fell into the hands of the thought police could not give them a complete list of members or any information that would lead them to a complete list
3763	no such list exists
3764	the brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense
3765	nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible
3766	you will never have anything to sustain you except the idea
3767	you will get no comradeship and no encouragement
3768	when finally you are caught you will get no help
3769	we never help our members
3770	at most when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoners cell
3771	you will have to get used to living without results and without hope
3772	you will work for a while you will be caught you will confess and then you will die
3773	those are the only results that you will ever see
3774	there is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime
3775	we are the dead
3776	our only true life is in the future
3777	we shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone
3778	but how far away that future may be there is no knowing
3779	it might be a thousand years
3780	at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little
3781	we cannot act collectively
3782	we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual generation after generation
3783	in the face of the thought police there is no other way
3784	he halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatch
3785	it is almost time for you to leave comrade he said to julia
3786	wait
3787	the decanter is still half full
3788	he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem
3789	what shall it be this time
3790	he said still with the same faint suggestion of irony
3791	to the confusion of the thought police
3792	to the death of big brother
3793	to humanity
3794	to the future
3795	to the past said winston
3796	the past is more important agreed obrien gravely
3797	they emptied their glasses and a moment later julia stood up to go
3798	obrien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue
3799	it was important he said not to go out smelling of wine the lift attendants were very observant
3800	as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence
3801	he took another pace or two up and down then stopped
3802	there are details to be settled he said
3803	i assume that you have a hidingplace of some kind
3804	winston explained about the room over mr charringtons shop
3805	that will do for the moment
3806	later we will arrange something else for you
3807	it is important to change ones hidingplace frequently
3808	meanwhile i shall send you a copy of the bookeven obrien winston noticed seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italicsgoldsteins book you understand as soon as possible
3809	it may be some days before i can get hold of one
3810	there are not many in existence as you can imagine
3811	the thought police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them
3812	it makes very little difference
3813	the book is indestructible
3814	if the last copy were gone we could reproduce it almost word for word
3815	do you carry a briefcase to work with you
3816	he added
3817	as a rule yes
3818	what is it like
3819	black very shabby
3820	with two straps
3821	black two straps very shabbygood
3822	one day in the fairly near futurei cannot give a dateone of the messages among your mornings work will contain a misprinted word and you will have to ask for a repeat
3823	on the following day you will go to work without your briefcase
3824	at some time during the day in the street a man will touch you on the arm and say i think you have dropped your briefcase
3825	the one he gives you will contain a copy of goldsteins book
3826	you will return it within fourteen days
3827	they were silent for a moment
3828	there are a couple of minutes before you need go said obrien
3829	we shall meet againif we do meet again
3830	winston looked up at him
3831	in the place where there is no darkness
3832	he said hesitantly
3833	obrien nodded without appearance of surprise
3834	in the place where there is no darkness he said as though he had recognized the allusion
3835	and in the meantime is there anything that you wish to say before you leave
3836	any message
3837	any question
3838	winston thought
3839	there did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask still less did he feel any impulse to utter highsounding generalities
3840	instead of anything directly connected with obrien or the brotherhood there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days and the little room over mr charringtons shop and the glass paperweight and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame
3841	almost at random he said
3842	did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
3843	again obrien nodded
3844	with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza
3845	oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements
3846	you owe me three farthings say the bells of st martins
3847	when will you pay me
3848	say the bells of old bailey
3849	when i grow rich say the bells of shoreditch
3850	you knew the last line
3851	said winston
3852	yes i knew the last line
3853	and now i am afraid it is time for you to go
3854	but wait
3855	you had better let me give you one of these tablets
3856	as winston stood up obrien held out a hand
3857	his powerful grip crushed the bones of winstons palm
3858	at the door winston looked back but obrien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind
3859	he was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen
3860	beyond him winston could see the writingtable with its greenshaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deepladen with papers
3861	the incident was closed
3862	within thirty seconds it occurred to him obrien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party
3863	chapter
3864	winston was gelatinous with fatigue
3865	gelatinous was the right word
3866	it had come into his head spontaneously
3867	his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly but its translucency
3868	he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it
3869	all the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work leaving only a frail structure of nerves bones and skin
3870	all sensations seemed to be magnified
3871	his overalls fretted his shoulders the pavement tickled his feet even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak
3872	he had worked more than ninety hours in five days
3873	so had everyone else in the ministry
3874	now it was all over and he had literally nothing to do no party work of any description until tomorrow morning
3875	he could spend six hours in the hidingplace and another nine in his own bed
3876	slowly in mild afternoon sunshine he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr charringtons shop keeping one eye open for the patrols but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him
3877	the heavy briefcase that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg
3878	inside it was the book which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened nor even looked at
3879	on the sixth day of hate week after the processions the speeches the shouting the singing the banners the posters the films the waxworks the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets the tramp of marching feet the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks the roar of massed planes the booming of gunsafter six days of this when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the eurasian warcriminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings they would unquestionably have torn them to piecesat just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia
3880	oceania was at war with eastasia
3881	eurasia was an ally
3882	there was of course no admission that any change had taken place
3883	merely it became known with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy
3884	winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened
3885	it was night and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit
3886	the square was packed with several thousand people including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spies
3887	on a scarletdraped platform an orator of the inner party a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled was haranguing the crowd
3888	a little rumpelstiltskin figure contorted with hatred he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other enormous at the end of a bony arm clawed the air menacingly above his head
3889	his voice made metallic by the amplifiers boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities massacres deportations lootings rapings torture of prisoners bombing of civilians lying propaganda unjust aggressions broken treaties
3890	it was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened
3891	at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats
3892	the most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren
3893	the speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speakers hand
3894	he unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech
3895	nothing altered in his voice or manner or in the content of what he was saying but suddenly the names were different
3896	without words said a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd
3897	oceania was at war with eastasia
3898	the next moment there was a tremendous commotion
3899	the banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong
3900	quite half of them had the wrong faces on them
3901	it was sabotage
3902	the agents of goldstein had been at work
3903	there was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot
3904	the spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys
3905	but within two or three minutes it was all over
3906	the orator still gripping the neck of the microphone his shoulders hunched forward his free hand clawing at the air had gone straight on with his speech
3907	one minute more and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd
3908	the hate continued exactly as before except that the target had been changed
3909	the thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence not only without a pause but without even breaking the syntax
3910	but at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him
3911	it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said excuse me i think youve dropped your briefcase
3912	he took the briefcase abstractedly without speaking
3913	he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it
3914	the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth though the time was now nearly twentythree hours
3915	the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise
3916	the orders already issuing from the telescreen recalling them to their posts were hardly necessary
3917	oceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at war with eastasia
3918	a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete
3919	reports and records of all kinds newspapers books pamphlets films soundtracks photographsall had to be rectified at lightning speed
3920	although no directive was ever issued it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia or the alliance with eastasia should remain in existence anywhere
3921	the work was overwhelming all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names
3922	everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the twentyfour with two threehour snatches of sleep
3923	mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors meals consisted of sandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen
3924	each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work and each time that he crawled back stickyeyed and aching it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work
3925	what was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical
3926	often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination
3927	even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable
3928	by the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes
3929	it was like struggling with some crushing physical task something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish
3930	in so far as he had time to remember it he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite every stroke of his inkpencil was a deliberate lie
3931	he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect
3932	on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down
3933	for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube then one more cylinder then nothing
3934	everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off
3935	a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department
3936	a mighty deed which could never be mentioned had been achieved
3937	it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened
3938	at twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning
3939	winston still carrying the briefcase containing the book which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept went home shaved himself and almost fell asleep in his bath although the water was barely more than tepid
3940	with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above mr charringtons shop
3941	he was tired but not sleepy any longer
3942	he opened the window lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee
3943	julia would arrive presently meanwhile there was the book
3944	he sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the briefcase
3945	a heavy black volume amateurishly bound with no name or title on the cover
3946	the print also looked slightly irregular
3947	the pages were worn at the edges and fell apart easily as though the book had passed through many hands
3948	the inscription on the titlepage ran
3949	the theory and practice of
3950	oligarchical collectivism
3951	by
3952	emmanuel goldstein
3953	winston began reading
3954	chapter i ignorance is strength
3955	throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low
3956	they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society has never altered
3957	even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other
3958	the aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable
3959	winston stopped reading chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading in comfort and safety
3960	he was alone no telescreen no ear at the keyhole no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand
3961	the sweet summer air played against his cheek
3962	from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock
3963	he settled deeper into the armchair and put his feet up on the fender
3964	it was bliss it was eternity
3965	suddenly as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and reread every word he opened it at a different place and found himself at chapter iii
3966	he went on reading
3967	chapter iii war is peace
3968	the splitting up of the world into three great superstates was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century
3969	with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states two of the three existing powers eurasia and oceania were already effectively in being
3970	the third eastasia only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting
3971	the frontiers between the three superstates are in some places arbitrary and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war but in general they follow geographical lines
3972	eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic landmass from portugal to the bering strait
3973	oceania comprises the americas the atlantic islands including the british isles australasia and the southern portion of africa
3974	eastasia smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier comprises china and the countries to the south of it the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria mongolia and tibet
3975	in one combination or another these three superstates are permanently at war and have been so for the past twentyfive years
3976	war however is no longer the desperate annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century
3977	it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference
3978	this is not to say that either the conduct of war or the prevailing attitude towards it has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous
3979	on the contrary war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries and such acts as raping looting the slaughter of children the reduction of whole populations to slavery and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive are looked upon as normal and when they are committed by ones own side and not by the enemy meritorious
3980	but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people mostly highlytrained specialists and causes comparatively few casualties
3981	the fighting when there is any takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes
3982	in the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths
3983	war has in fact changed its character
3984	more exactly the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance
3985	motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon
3986	to understand the nature of the present warfor in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years it is always the same warone must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive
3987	none of the three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination
3988	they are too evenly matched and their natural defences are too formidable
3989	eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants
3990	secondly there is no longer in a material sense anything to fight about
3991	with the establishment of selfcontained economies in which production and consumption are geared to one another the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death
3992	in any case each of the three superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries
3993	in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose it is a war for labour power
3994	between the frontiers of the superstates and not permanently in the possession of any of them there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier brazzaville darwin and hong kong containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth
3995	it is for the possession of these thicklypopulated regions and of the northern icecap that the three powers are constantly struggling
3996	in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area
3997	portions of it are constantly changing hands and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment
3998	all of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods
3999	but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour
4000	whichever power controls equatorial africa or the countries of the middle east or southern india or the indonesian archipelago disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of illpaid and hardworking coolies
4001	the inhabitants of these areas reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves pass continually from conqueror to conqueror and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments to capture more territory to control more labour power to turn out more armaments to capture more territory and so on indefinitely
4002	it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas
4003	the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the mediterranean the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by oceania or by eastasia in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stable round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored but the balance of power always remains roughly even and the territory which forms the heartland of each superstate always remains inviolate
4004	moreover the labour of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the worlds economy
4005	they add nothing to the wealth of the world since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war
4006	by their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up
4007	but if they did not exist the structure of world society and the process by which it maintains itself would not be essentially different
4008	the primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principles of doublethink this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living
4009	ever since the end of the nineteenth century the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society
4010	at present when few human beings even have enough to eat this problem is obviously not urgent and it might not have become so even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work
4011	the world of today is a bare hungry dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward
4012	in the early twentieth century the vision of a future society unbelievably rich leisured orderly and efficienta glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snowwhite concretewas part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person
4013	science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing
4014	this failed to happen partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought which could not survive in a strictly regimented society
4015	as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago
4016	certain backward areas have advanced and various devices always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage have been developed but experiment and invention have largely stopped and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteenfifties have never been fully repaired
4017	nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there
4018	from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery and therefore to a great extent for human inequality had disappeared
4019	if the machine were used deliberately for that end hunger overwork dirt illiteracy and disease could be eliminated within a few generations
4020	and in fact without being used for any such purpose but by a sort of automatic processby producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distributethe machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries
4021	but it was also clear that an allround increase in wealth threatened the destructionindeed in some sense was the destructionof a hierarchical society
4022	in a world in which everyone worked short hours had enough to eat lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator and possessed a motorcar or even an aeroplane the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared
4023	if it once became general wealth would confer no distinction
4024	it was possible no doubt to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries should be evenly distributed while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste
4025	but in practice such a society could not long remain stable
4026	for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves and when once they had done this they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function and they would sweep it away
4027	in the long run a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance
4028	to return to the agricultural past as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing was not a practicable solution
4029	it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasiinstinctive throughout almost the whole world and moreover any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated directly or indirectly by its more advanced rivals
4030	nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods
4031	this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism roughly between and
4032	the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate land went out of cultivation capital equipment was not added to great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity
4033	but this too entailed military weakness and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary it made opposition inevitable
4034	the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world
4035	goods must be produced but they must not be distributed
4036	and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare
4037	the essential act of war is destruction not necessarily of human lives but of the products of human labour
4038	war is a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking in the depths of the sea materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable and hence in the long run too intelligent
4039	even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed
4040	a floating fortress for example has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargoships
4041	ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete never having brought any material benefit to anybody and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built
4042	in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population
4043	in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life but this is looked on as an advantage
4044	it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another
4045	by the standards of the early twentieth century even a member of the inner party lives an austere laborious kind of life
4046	nevertheless the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large wellappointed flat the better texture of his clothes the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco his two or three servants his private motorcar or helicopterset him in a different world from a member of the outer party and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call the proles
4047	the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty
4048	and at the same time the consciousness of being at war and therefore in danger makes the handingover of all power to a small caste seem the natural unavoidable condition of survival
4049	war it will be seen accomplishes the necessary destruction but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way
4050	in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids by digging holes and filling them up again or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them
4051	but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society
4052	what is concerned here is not the morale of masses whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work but the morale of the party itself
4053	even the humblest party member is expected to be competent industrious and even intelligent within narrow limits but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear hatred adulation and orgiastic triumph
4054	in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war
4055	it does not matter whether the war is actually happening and since no decisive victory is possible it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly
4056	all that is needed is that a state of war should exist
4057	the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war is now almost universal but the higher up the ranks one goes the more marked it becomes
4058	it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest
4059	in his capacity as an administrator it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink
4060	meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real and that it is bound to end victoriously with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world
4061	all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith
4062	it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon
4063	the search for new weapons continues unceasingly and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet
4064	in oceania at the present day science in the old sense has almost ceased to exist
4065	in newspeak there is no word for science
4066	the empirical method of thought on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc
4067	and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty
4068	in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards
4069	the fields are cultivated with horseploughs while books are written by machinery
4070	but in matters of vital importancemeaning in effect war and police espionagethe empirical approach is still encouraged or at least tolerated
4071	the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought
4072	there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve
4073	one is how to discover against his will what another human being is thinking and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand
4074	in so far as scientific research still continues this is its subject matter
4075	the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions gestures and tones of voice and testing the truthproducing effects of drugs shock therapy hypnosis and physical torture or he is chemist physicist or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life
4076	in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests or in the australian desert or on lost islands of the antarctic the teams of experts are indefatigably at work
4077	some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars others devise larger and larger rocket bombs more and more powerful explosives and more and more impenetrable armourplating others search for new and deadlier gases or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailingship others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the suns rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earths centre
4078	but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization and none of the three superstates ever gains a significant lead on the others
4079	what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess in the atomic bomb a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover
4080	although the party according to its habit claims the invention for itself atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteenforties and were first used on a large scale about ten years later
4081	at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres chiefly in european russia western europe and north america
4082	the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society and hence of their own power
4083	thereafter although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at no more bombs were dropped
4084	all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later
4085	and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years
4086	helicopters are more used than they were formerly bombing planes have been largely superseded by selfpropelled projectiles and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress but otherwise there has been little development
4087	the tank the submarine the torpedo the machine gun even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use
4088	and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens the desperate battles of earlier wars in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks have never been repeated
4089	none of the three superstates ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat
4090	when any large operation is undertaken it is usually a surprise attack against an ally
4091	the strategy that all three powers are following or pretend to themselves that they are following is the same
4092	the plan is by a combination of fighting bargaining and welltimed strokes of treachery to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep
4093	during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots finally they will all be fired simultaneously with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible
4094	it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining worldpower in preparation for another attack
4095	this scheme it is hardly necessary to say is a mere daydream impossible of realization
4096	moreover no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken
4097	this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary
4098	eurasia for example could easily conquer the british isles which are geographically part of europe or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula
4099	but this would violate the principle followed on all sides though never formulated of cultural integrity
4100	if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants a task of great physical difficulty or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people who so far as technical development goes are roughly on the oceanic level
4101	the problem is the same for all three superstates
4102	it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except to a limited extent with war prisoners and coloured slaves
4103	even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion
4104	war prisoners apart the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages
4105	if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies
4106	the sealed world in which he lives would be broken and the fear hatred and selfrighteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate
4107	it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia or egypt or java or ceylon may change hands the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs
4108	under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud but tacitly understood and acted upon namely that the conditions of life in all three superstates are very much the same
4109	in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc in eurasia it is called neobolshevism and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as deathworship but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self
4110	the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense
4111	actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all
4112	everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure the same worship of semidivine leader the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare
4113	it follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquer one another but would gain no advantage by doing so
4114	on the contrary so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up like three sheaves of corn
4115	and as usual the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing
4116	their lives are dedicated to world conquest but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory
4117	meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought
4118	here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character
4119	in past ages a war almost by definition was something that sooner or later came to an end usually in unmistakable victory or defeat
4120	in the past also war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality
4121	all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency
4122	so long as defeat meant the loss of independence or some other result generally held to be undesirable the precautions against defeat had to be serious
4123	physical facts could not be ignored
4124	in philosophy or religion or ethics or politics two and two might make five but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four
4125	inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions
4126	moreover to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past
4127	newspapers and history books were of course always coloured and biased but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible
4128	war was a sure safeguard of sanity and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards
4129	while wars could be won or lost no ruling class could be completely irresponsible
4130	but when war becomes literally continuous it also ceases to be dangerous
4131	when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity
4132	technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded
4133	as we have seen researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming and their failure to show results is not important
4134	efficiency even military efficiency is no longer needed
4135	nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police
4136	since each of the three superstates is unconquerable each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised
4137	reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday lifethe need to eat and drink to get shelter and clothing to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of topstorey windows and the like
4138	between life and death and between physical pleasure and physical pain there is still a distinction but that is all
4139	cut off from contact with the outer world and with the past the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down
4140	the rulers of such a state are absolute as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be
4141	they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals but once that minimum is achieved they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose
4142	the war therefore if we judge it by the standards of previous wars is merely an imposture
4143	it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another
4144	but though it is unreal it is not meaningless
4145	it eats up the surplus of consumable goods and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs
4146	war it will be seen is now a purely internal affair
4147	in the past the ruling groups of all countries although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war did fight against one another and the victor always plundered the vanquished
4148	in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all
4149	the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory but to keep the structure of society intact
4150	the very word war therefore has become misleading
4151	it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist
4152	the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different
4153	the effect would be much the same if the three superstates instead of fighting one another should agree to live in perpetual peace each inviolate within its own boundaries
4154	for in that case each would still be a selfcontained universe freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger
4155	a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war
4156	thisalthough the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower senseis the inner meaning of the party slogan war is peace
4157	winston stopped reading for a moment
4158	somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered
4159	the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book in a room with no telescreen had not worn off
4160	solitude and safety were physical sensations mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body the softness of the chair the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek
4161	the book fascinated him or more exactly it reassured him
4162	in a sense it told him nothing that was new but that was part of the attraction
4163	it said what he would have said if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order
4164	it was the product of a mind similar to his own but enormously more powerful more systematic less fearridden
4165	the best books he perceived are those that tell you what you know already
4166	he had just turned back to chapter i when he heard julias footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her
4167	she dumped her brown toolbag on the floor and flung herself into his arms
4168	it was more than a week since they had seen one another
4169	ive got the book he said as they disentangled themselves
4170	oh youve got it
4171	good she said without much interest and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee
4172	they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour
4173	the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane
4174	from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones
4175	the brawny redarmed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard
4176	there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song
4177	julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep
4178	he reached out for the book which was lying on the floor and sat up against the bedhead
4179	we must read it he said
4180	you too
4181	all members of the brotherhood have to read it
4182	you read it she said with her eyes shut
4183	read it aloud
4184	thats the best way
4185	then you can explain it to me as you go
4186	the clocks hands said six meaning eighteen
4187	they had three or four hours ahead of them
4188	he propped the book against his knees and began reading
4189	chapter i ignorance is strength
4190	throughout recorded time and probably since the end of the neolithic age there have been three kinds of people in the world the high the middle and the low
4191	they have been subdivided in many ways they have borne countless different names and their relative numbers as well as their attitude towards one another have varied from age to age but the essential structure of society has never altered
4192	even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes the same pattern has always reasserted itself just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium however far it is pushed one way or the other
4193	julia are you awake
4194	said winston
4195	yes my love im listening
4196	go on
4197	its marvellous
4198	he continued reading
4199	the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable
4200	the aim of the high is to remain where they are
4201	the aim of the middle is to change places with the high
4202	the aim of the low when they have an aimfor it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily livesis to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal
4203	thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again
4204	for long periods the high seem to be securely in power but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently or both
4205	they are then overthrown by the middle who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice
4206	as soon as they have reached their objective the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude and themselves become the high
4207	presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups or from both of them and the struggle begins over again
4208	of the three groups only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims
4209	it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind
4210	even today in a period of decline the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago
4211	but no advance in wealth no softening of manners no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer
4212	from the point of view of the low no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters
4213	by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers
4214	there then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life
4215	this doctrine of course had always had its adherents but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change
4216	in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high
4217	it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests lawyers and the like who were parasitical upon them and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave
4218	the middle so long as it was struggling for power had always made use of such terms as freedom justice and fraternity
4219	now however the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command but merely hoped to be so before long
4220	in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown
4221	the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand
4222	socialism a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages
4223	but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned
4224	the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century ingsoc in oceania neobolshevism in eurasia deathworship as it is commonly called in eastasia had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality
4225	these new movements of course grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lipservice to their ideology
4226	but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment
4227	the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more and then stop
4228	as usual the high were to be turned out by the middle who would then become the high but this time by conscious strategy the high would be able to maintain their position permanently
4229	the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge and the growth of the historical sense which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century
4230	the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible or appeared to be so and if it was intelligible then it was alterable
4231	but the principal underlying cause was that as early as the beginning of the twentieth century human equality had become technically possible
4232	it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth
4233	in earlier ages class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable
4234	inequality was the price of civilization
4235	with the development of machine production however the case was altered
4236	even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels
4237	therefore from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after but a danger to be averted
4238	in more primitive ages when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible it had been fairly easy to believe it
4239	the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood without laws and without brute labour had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years
4240	and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change
4241	the heirs of the french english and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man freedom of speech equality before the law and the like and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent
4242	but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian
4243	the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable
4244	every new political theory by whatever name it called itself led back to hierarchy and regimentation
4245	and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about practices which had been long abandoned in some cases for hundreds of yearsimprisonment without trial the use of war prisoners as slaves public executions torture to extract confessions the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populationsnot only became common again but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive
4246	it was only after a decade of national wars civil wars revolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully workedout political theories
4247	but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems generally called totalitarian which had appeared earlier in the century and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious
4248	what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious
4249	the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats scientists technicians tradeunion organizers publicity experts sociologists teachers journalists and professional politicians
4250	these people whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government
4251	as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages they were less avaricious less tempted by luxury hungrier for pure power and above all more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition
4252	this last difference was cardinal
4253	by comparison with that existing today all the tyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient
4254	the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas and were content to leave loose ends everywhere to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking
4255	even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards
4256	part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance
4257	the invention of print however made it easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and the radio carried the process further
4258	with the development of television and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument private life came to an end
4259	every citizen or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching could be kept for twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda with all other channels of communication closed
4260	the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects now existed for the first time
4261	after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties society regrouped itself as always into high middle and low
4262	but the new high group unlike all its forerunners did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position
4263	it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism
4264	wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly
4265	the socalled abolition of private property which took place in the middle years of the century meant in effect the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before but with this difference that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals
4266	individually no member of the party owns anything except petty personal belongings
4267	collectively the party owns everything in oceania because it controls everything and disposes of the products as it thinks fit
4268	in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization
4269	it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated socialism must follow and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated
4270	factories mines land houses transporteverything had been taken away from them and since these things were no longer private property it followed that they must be public property
4271	ingsoc which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited its phraseology has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist programme with the result foreseen and intended beforehand that economic inequality has been made permanent
4272	but the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this
4273	there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power
4274	either it is conquered from without or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being or it loses its own selfconfidence and willingness to govern
4275	these causes do not operate singly and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree
4276	a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently
4277	ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself
4278	after the middle of the present century the first danger had in reality disappeared
4279	each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert
4280	the second danger also is only a theoretical one
4281	the masses never revolt of their own accord and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed
4282	indeed so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison they never even become aware that they are oppressed
4283	the recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate
4284	as for the problem of overproduction which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique it is solved by the device of continuous warfare see chapter iii which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch
4285	from the point of view of our present rulers therefore the only genuine dangers are the splittingoff of a new group of able underemployed powerhungry people and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks
4286	the problem that is to say is educational
4287	it is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it
4288	the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way
4289	given this background one could infer if one did not know it already the general structure of oceanic society
4290	at the apex of the pyramid comes big brother
4291	big brother is infallible and allpowerful
4292	every success every achievement every victory every scientific discovery all knowledge all wisdom all happiness all virtue are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration
4293	nobody has ever seen big brother
4294	he is a face on the hoardings a voice on the telescreen
4295	we may be reasonably sure that he will never die and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born
4296	big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world
4297	his function is to act as a focusing point for love fear and reverence emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization
4298	below big brother comes the inner party
4299	its numbers limited to six millions or something less than per cent of the population of oceania
4300	below the inner party comes the outer party which if the inner party is described as the brain of the state may be justly likened to the hands
4301	below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as the proles numbering perhaps per cent of the population
4302	in the terms of our earlier classification the proles are the low for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure
4303	in principle membership of these three groups is not hereditary
4304	the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party
4305	admission to either branch of the party is by examination taken at the age of sixteen
4306	nor is there any racial discrimination or any marked domination of one province by another
4307	jews negroes south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area
4308	in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital
4309	oceania has no capital and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows
4310	except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language it is not centralized in any way
4311	its rulers are not held together by bloodties but by adherence to a common doctrine
4312	it is true that our society is stratified and very rigidly stratified on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines
4313	there is far less toandfro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the preindustrial age
4314	between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to rise
4315	proletarians in practice are not allowed to graduate into the party
4316	the most gifted among them who might possibly become nuclei of discontent are simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated
4317	but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent nor is it a matter of principle
4318	the party is not a class in the old sense of the word
4319	it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children as such and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat
4320	in the crucial years the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition
4321	the older kind of socialist who had been trained to fight against something called class privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent
4322	he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years
4323	the essence of oligarchical rule is not fathertoson inheritance but the persistence of a certain worldview and a certain way of life imposed by the dead upon the living
4324	a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors
4325	the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself
4326	who wields power is not important provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same
4327	all the beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of presentday society from being perceived
4328	physical rebellion or any preliminary move towards rebellion is at present not possible
4329	from the proletarians nothing is to be feared
4330	left to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century working breeding and dying not only without any impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is
4331	they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly but since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important the level of popular education is actually declining
4332	what opinions the masses hold or do not hold is looked on as a matter of indifference
4333	they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect
4334	in a party member on the other hand not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated
4335	a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police
4336	even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone
4337	wherever he may be asleep or awake working or resting in his bath or in bed he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected
4338	nothing that he does is indifferent
4339	his friendships his relaxations his behaviour towards his wife and children the expression of his face when he is alone the words he mutters in sleep even the characteristic movements of his body are all jealously scrutinized
4340	not only any actual misdemeanour but any eccentricity however small any change of habits any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle is certain to be detected
4341	he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever
4342	on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour
4343	in oceania there is no law
4344	thoughts and actions which when detected mean certain death are not formally forbidden and the endless purges arrests tortures imprisonments and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed but are merely the wipingout of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future
4345	a party member is required to have not only the right opinions but the right instincts
4346	many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc
4347	if he is a person naturally orthodox in newspeak a goodthinker he will in all circumstances know without taking thought what is the true belief or the desirable emotion
4348	but in any case an elaborate mental training undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop blackwhite and doublethink makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever
4349	a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm
4350	he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors triumph over victories and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the party
4351	the discontents produced by his bare unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline
4352	the first and simplest stage in the discipline which can be taught even to young children is called in newspeak crimestop
4353	crimestop means the faculty of stopping short as though by instinct at the threshold of any dangerous thought
4354	it includes the power of not grasping analogies of failing to perceive logical errors of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction
4355	crimestop in short means protective stupidity
4356	but stupidity is not enough
4357	on the contrary orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over ones own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body
4358	oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible
4359	but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible there is need for an unwearying momenttomoment flexibility in the treatment of facts
4360	the keyword here is blackwhite
4361	like so many newspeak words this word has two mutually contradictory meanings
4362	applied to an opponent it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain facts
4363	applied to a party member it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this
4364	but it means also the ability to believe that black is white and more to know that black is white and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary
4365	this demands a continuous alteration of the past made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest and which is known in newspeak as doublethink
4366	the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons one of which is subsidiary and so to speak precautionary
4367	the subsidiary reason is that the party member like the proletarian tolerates presentday conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison
4368	he must be cut off from the past just as he must be cut off from foreign countries because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising
4369	but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party
4370	it is not merely that speeches statistics and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right
4371	it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted
4372	for to change ones mind or even ones policy is a confession of weakness
4373	if for example eurasia or eastasia whichever it may be is the enemy today then that country must always have been the enemy
4374	and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered
4375	thus history is continuously rewritten
4376	this daytoday falsification of the past carried out by the ministry of truth is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love
4377	the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc
4378	past events it is argued have no objective existence but survive only in written records and in human memories
4379	the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon
4380	and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it
4381	it also follows that though the past is alterable it never has been altered in any specific instance
4382	for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment then this new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed
4383	this holds good even when as often happens the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year
4384	at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now
4385	it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory
4386	to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act
4387	but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner
4388	and if it is necessary to rearrange ones memories or to tamper with written records then it is necessary to forget that one has done so
4389	the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique
4390	it is learned by the majority of party members and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox
4391	in oldspeak it is called quite frankly reality control
4392	in newspeak it is called doublethink though doublethink comprises much else as well
4393	doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in ones mind simultaneously and accepting both of them
4394	the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated
4395	the process has to be conscious or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision but it also has to be unconscious or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt
4396	doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty
4397	to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient and then when it becomes necessary again to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one deniesall this is indispensably necessary
4398	even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink
4399	for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge and so on indefinitely with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth
4400	ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been ableand may for all we know continue to be able for thousands of yearsto arrest the course of history
4401	all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft
4402	either they became stupid and arrogant failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances and were overthrown or they became liberal and cowardly made concessions when they should have used force and once again were overthrown
4403	they fell that is to say either through consciousness or through unconsciousness
4404	it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously
4405	and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent
4406	if one is to rule and to continue ruling one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality
4407	for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in ones own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes
4408	it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating
4409	in our society those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is
4410	in general the greater the understanding the greater the delusion the more intelligent the less sane
4411	one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale
4412	those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories
4413	to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave
4414	which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them
4415	they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones
4416	the slightly more favoured workers whom we call the proles are only intermittently conscious of the war
4417	when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening
4418	it is in the ranks of the party and above all of the inner party that the true war enthusiasm is found
4419	worldconquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible
4420	this peculiar linkingtogether of oppositesknowledge with ignorance cynicism with fanaticismis one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society
4421	the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them
4422	thus the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism
4423	it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason
4424	it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty
4425	even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts
4426	the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation
4427	these contradictions are not accidental nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy they are deliberate exercises in doublethink
4428	for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely
4429	in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken
4430	if human equality is to be for ever avertedif the high as we have called them are to keep their places permanentlythen the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity
4431	but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored
4432	it is why should human equality be averted
4433	supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described what is the motive for this huge accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time
4434	here we reach the central secret
4435	as we have seen
4436	the mystique of the party and above all of the inner party depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies the original motive the neverquestioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink the thought police continuous warfare and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards
4437	this motive really consists
4438	winston became aware of silence as one becomes aware of a new sound
4439	it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past
4440	she was lying on her side naked from the waist upwards with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes
4441	her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly
4442	julia
4443	no answer
4444	julia are you awake
4445	no answer
4446	she was asleep
4447	he shut the book put it carefully on the floor lay down and pulled the coverlet over both of them
4448	he had still he reflected not learned the ultimate secret
4449	he understood how he did not understand why
4450	chapter i like chapter iii had not actually told him anything that he did not know it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already
4451	but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad
4452	being in a minority even a minority of one did not make you mad
4453	there was truth and there was untruth and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world you were not mad
4454	a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow
4455	he shut his eyes
4456	the sun on his face and the girls smooth body touching his own gave him a strong sleepy confident feeling
4457	he was safe everything was all right
4458	he fell asleep murmuring sanity is not statistical with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom
4459	when he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time but a glance at the oldfashioned clock told him that it was only twentythirty
4460	he lay dozing for a while then the usual deeplunged singing struck up from the yard below
4461	it was only an opeless fancy
4462	it passed like an ipril dye
4463	but a look an a word an the dreams they stirred
4464	they ave stolen my eart awye
4465	the drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity
4466	you still heard it all over the place
4467	it had outlived the hate song
4468	julia woke at the sound stretched herself luxuriously and got out of bed
4469	im hungry she said
4470	lets make some more coffee
4471	damn
4472	the stoves gone out and the waters cold
4473	she picked the stove up and shook it
4474	theres no oil in it
4475	we can get some from old charrington i expect
4476	the funny thing is i made sure it was full
4477	im going to put my clothes on she added
4478	it seems to have got colder
4479	winston also got up and dressed himself
4480	the indefatigable voice sang on
4481	they sye that time eals all things
4482	they sye you can always forget
4483	but the smiles an the tears acrorss the years
4484	they twist my eartstrings yet
4485	as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window
4486	the sun must have gone down behind the houses it was not shining into the yard any longer
4487	the flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimneypots
4488	tirelessly the woman marched to and fro corking and uncorking herself singing and falling silent and pegging out more diapers and more and yet more
4489	he wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren
4490	julia had come across to his side together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below
4491	as he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude her thick arms reaching up for the line her powerful marelike buttocks protruded it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful
4492	it had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing then hardened roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an overripe turnip could be beautiful
4493	but it was so and after all he thought why not
4494	the solid contourless body like a block of granite and the rasping red skin bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rosehip to the rose
4495	why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower
4496	shes beautiful he murmured
4497	shes a metre across the hips easily said julia
4498	that is her style of beauty said winston
4499	he held julias supple waist easily encircled by his arm
4500	from the hip to the knee her flank was against his
4501	out of their bodies no child would ever come
4502	that was the one thing they could never do
4503	only by word of mouth from mind to mind could they pass on the secret
4504	the woman down there had no mind she had only strong arms a warm heart and a fertile belly
4505	he wondered how many children she had given birth to
4506	it might easily be fifteen
4507	she had had her momentary flowering a year perhaps of wildrose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse and then her life had been laundering scrubbing darning cooking sweeping polishing mending scrubbing laundering first for children then for grandchildren over thirty unbroken years
4508	at the end of it she was still singing
4509	the mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale cloudless sky stretching away behind the chimneypots into interminable distance
4510	it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody in eurasia or eastasia as well as here
4511	and the people under the sky were also very much the sameeverywhere all over the world hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this people ignorant of one anothers existence held apart by walls of hatred and lies and yet almost exactly the samepeople who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world
4512	if there was hope it lay in the proles
4513	without having read to the end of the book he knew that that must be goldsteins final message
4514	the future belonged to the proles
4515	and could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him winston smith as the world of the party
4516	yes because at the least it would be a world of sanity
4517	where there is equality there can be sanity
4518	sooner or later it would happen strength would change into consciousness
4519	the proles were immortal you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard
4520	in the end their awakening would come
4521	and until that happened though it might be a thousand years they would stay alive against all the odds like birds passing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not share and could not kill
4522	do you remember he said the thrush that sang to us that first day at the edge of the wood
4523	he wasnt singing to us said julia
4524	he was singing to please himself
4525	not even that
4526	he was just singing
4527	the birds sang the proles sang
4528	the party did not sing
4529	all round the world in london and new york in africa and brazil and in the mysterious forbidden lands beyond the frontiers in the streets of paris and berlin in the villages of the endless russian plain in the bazaars of china and japaneverywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure made monstrous by work and childbearing toiling from birth to death and still singing
4530	out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come
4531	you were the dead theirs was the future
4532	but you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four
4533	we are the dead he said
4534	we are the dead echoed julia dutifully
4535	you are the dead said an iron voice behind them
4536	they sprang apart
4537	winstons entrails seemed to have turned into ice
4538	he could see the white all round the irises of julias eyes
4539	her face had turned a milky yellow
4540	the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath
4541	you are the dead repeated the iron voice
4542	it was behind the picture breathed julia
4543	it was behind the picture said the voice
4544	remain exactly where you are
4545	make no movement until you are ordered
4546	it was starting it was starting at last
4547	they could do nothing except stand gazing into one anothers eyes
4548	to run for life to get out of the house before it was too lateno such thought occurred to them
4549	unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall
4550	there was a snap as though a catch had been turned back and a crash of breaking glass
4551	the picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it
4552	now they can see us said julia
4553	now we can see you said the voice
4554	stand out in the middle of the room
4555	stand back to back
4556	clasp your hands behind your heads
4557	do not touch one another
4558	they were not touching but it seemed to him that he could feel julias body shaking
4559	or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own
4560	he could just stop his teeth from chattering but his knees were beyond his control
4561	there was a sound of trampling boots below inside the house and outside
4562	the yard seemed to be full of men
4563	something was being dragged across the stones
4564	the womans singing had stopped abruptly
4565	there was a long rolling clang as though the washtub had been flung across the yard and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain
4566	the house is surrounded said winston
4567	the house is surrounded said the voice
4568	he heard julia snap her teeth together
4569	i suppose we may as well say goodbye she said
4570	you may as well say goodbye said the voice
4571	and then another quite different voice a thin cultivated voice which winston had the impression of having heard before struck in and by the way while we are on the subject here comes a candle to light you to bed here comes a chopper to chop off your head
4572	something crashed on to the bed behind winstons back
4573	the head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame
4574	someone was climbing through the window
4575	there was a stampede of boots up the stairs
4576	the room was full of solid men in black uniforms with ironshod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands
4577	winston was not trembling any longer
4578	even his eyes he barely moved
4579	one thing alone mattered to keep still to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you
4580	a man with a smooth prizefighters jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger
4581	winston met his eyes
4582	the feeling of nakedness with ones hands behind ones head and ones face and body all exposed was almost unbearable
4583	the man protruded the tip of a white tongue licked the place where his lips should have been and then passed on
4584	there was another crash
4585	someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearthstone
4586	the fragment of coral a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake rolled across the mat
4587	how small thought winston how small it always was
4588	there was a gasp and a thump behind him and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance
4589	one of the men had smashed his fist into julias solar plexus doubling her up like a pocket ruler
4590	she was thrashing about on the floor fighting for breath
4591	winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre but sometimes her livid gasping face came within the angle of his vision
4592	even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath
4593	he knew what it was like the terrible agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe
4594	then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders and carried her out of the room like a sack
4595	winston had a glimpse of her face upside down yellow and contorted with the eyes shut and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek and that was the last he saw of her
4596	he stood dead still
4597	no one had hit him yet
4598	thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind
4599	he wondered whether they had got mr charrington
4600	he wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard
4601	he noticed that he badly wanted to urinate and felt a faint surprise because he had done so only two or three hours ago
4602	he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine meaning twentyone
4603	but the light seemed too strong
4604	would not the light be fading at twentyone hours on an august evening
4605	he wondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken the timehad slept the clock round and thought it was twentythirty when really it was nought eightthirty on the following morning
4606	but he did not pursue the thought further
4607	it was not interesting
4608	there was another lighter step in the passage
4609	mr charrington came into the room
4610	the demeanour of the blackuniformed men suddenly became more subdued
4611	something had also changed in mr charringtons appearance
4612	his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight
4613	pick up those pieces he said sharply
4614	a man stooped to obey
4615	the cockney accent had disappeared winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen
4616	mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket but his hair which had been almost white had turned black
4617	also he was not wearing his spectacles
4618	he gave winston a single sharp glance as though verifying his identity and then paid no more attention to him
4619	he was still recognizable but he was not the same person any longer
4620	his body had straightened and seemed to have grown bigger
4621	his face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation
4622	the black eyebrows were less bushy the wrinkles were gone the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered even the nose seemed shorter
4623	it was the alert cold face of a man of about fiveandthirty
4624	it occurred to winston that for the first time in his life he was looking with knowledge at a member of the thought police
4625	part three
4626	chapter
4627	he did not know where he was
4628	presumably he was in the ministry of love but there was no way of making certain
4629	he was in a highceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain
4630	concealed lamps flooded it with cold light and there was a low steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply
4631	a bench or shelf just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall broken only by the door and at the end opposite the door a lavatory pan with no wooden seat
4632	there were four telescreens one in each wall
4633	there was a dull aching in his belly
4634	it had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away
4635	but he was also hungry with a gnawing unwholesome kind of hunger
4636	it might be twentyfour hours since he had eaten it might be thirtysix
4637	he still did not know probably never would know whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him
4638	since he was arrested he had not been fed
4639	he sat as still as he could on the narrow bench with his hands crossed on his knee
4640	he had already learned to sit still
4641	if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen
4642	but the craving for food was growing upon him
4643	what he longed for above all was a piece of bread
4644	he had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls
4645	it was even possiblehe thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his legthat there might be a sizeable bit of crust there
4646	in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear he slipped a hand into his pocket
4647	smith
4648	yelled a voice from the telescreen
4649	smith w
4650	hands out of pockets in the cells
4651	he sat still again his hands crossed on his knee
4652	before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lockup used by the patrols
4653	he did not know how long he had been there some hours at any rate with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time
4654	it was a noisy evilsmelling place
4655	they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people
4656	the majority of them were common criminals but there were a few political prisoners among them
4657	he had sat silent against the wall jostled by dirty bodies too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the party prisoners and the others
4658	the party prisoners were always silent and terrified but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody
4659	they yelled insults at the guards fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded wrote obscene words on the floor ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hidingplaces in their clothes and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order
4660	on the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards called them by nicknames and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door
4661	the guards too treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance even when they had to handle them roughly
4662	there was much talk about the forcedlabour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent
4663	it was all right in the camps he gathered so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes
4664	there was bribery favouritism and racketeering of every kind there was homosexuality and prostitution there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes
4665	the positions of trust were given only to the common criminals especially the gangsters and the murderers who formed a sort of aristocracy
4666	all the dirty jobs were done by the politicals
4667	there was a constant comeandgo of prisoners of every description drugpeddlers thieves bandits blackmarketeers drunks prostitutes
4668	some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them
4669	an enormous wreck of a woman aged about sixty with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles was carried in kicking and shouting by four guards who had hold of her one at each corner
4670	they wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them and dumped her down across winstons lap almost breaking his thighbones
4671	the woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of f bastards
4672	then noticing that she was sitting on something uneven she slid off winstons knees on to the bench
4673	beg pardon dearie she said
4674	i wouldnt a sat on you only the buggers put me there
4675	they dono ow to treat a lady do they
4676	she paused patted her breast and belched
4677	pardon she said i aint meself quite
4678	she leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor
4679	thass better she said leaning back with closed eyes
4680	never keep it down thass what i say
4681	get it up while its fresh on your stomach like
4682	she revived turned to have another look at winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him
4683	she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her breathing beer and vomit into his face
4684	wass your name dearie
4685	she said
4686	smith said winston
4687	smith
4688	said the woman
4689	thass funny
4690	my names smith too
4691	why she added sentimentally i might be your mother
4692	she might thought winston be his mother
4693	she was about the right age and physique and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forcedlabour camp
4694	no one else had spoken to him
4695	to a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the party prisoners
4696	the polits they called them with a sort of uninterested contempt
4697	the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody and above all of speaking to one another
4698	only once when two party members both women were pressed close together on the bench he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedlywhispered words and in particular a reference to something called room oneohone which he did not understand
4699	it might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here
4700	the dull pain in his belly never went away but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly
4701	when it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself and of his desire for food
4702	when it grew better panic took hold of him
4703	there were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped
4704	he felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and ironshod boots on his shins he saw himself grovelling on the floor screaming for mercy through broken teeth
4705	he hardly thought of julia
4706	he could not fix his mind on her
4707	he loved her and would not betray her but that was only a fact known as he knew the rules of arithmetic
4708	he felt no love for her and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her
4709	he thought oftener of obrien with a flickering hope
4710	obrien might know that he had been arrested
4711	the brotherhood he had said never tried to save its members
4712	but there was the razor blade they would send the razor blade if they could
4713	there would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell
4714	the blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone
4715	everything came back to his sick body which shrank trembling from the smallest pain
4716	he was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance
4717	it was more natural to exist from moment to moment accepting another ten minutes life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it
4718	sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell
4719	it should have been easy but he always lost count at some point or another
4720	more often he wondered where he was and what time of day it was
4721	at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness
4722	in this place he knew instinctively the lights would never be turned out
4723	it was the place with no darkness he saw now why obrien had seemed to recognize the allusion
4724	in the ministry of love there were no windows
4725	his cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall it might be ten floors below ground or thirty above it
4726	he moved himself mentally from place to place and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground
4727	there was a sound of marching boots outside
4728	the steel door opened with a clang
4729	a young officer a trim blackuniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather and whose pale straightfeatured face was like a wax mask stepped smartly through the doorway
4730	he motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading
4731	the poet ampleforth shambled into the cell
4732	the door clanged shut again
4733	ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of and then began to wander up and down the cell
4734	he had not yet noticed winstons presence
4735	his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of winstons head
4736	he was shoeless large dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks
4737	he was also several days away from a shave
4738	a scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements
4739	winston roused himself a little from his lethargy
4740	he must speak to ampleforth and risk the yell from the telescreen
4741	it was even conceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade
4742	ampleforth he said
4743	there was no yell from the telescreen
4744	ampleforth paused mildly startled
4745	his eyes focused themselves slowly on winston
4746	ah smith
4747	he said
4748	you too
4749	what are you in for
4750	to tell you the truth he sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite winston
4751	there is only one offence is there not
4752	he said
4753	and have you committed it
4754	apparently i have
4755	he put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment as though trying to remember something
4756	these things happen he began vaguely
4757	i have been able to recall one instancea possible instance
4758	it was an indiscretion undoubtedly
4759	we were producing a definitive edition of the poems of kipling
4760	i allowed the word god to remain at the end of a line
4761	i could not help it
4762	he added almost indignantly raising his face to look at winston
4763	it was impossible to change the line
4764	the rhyme was rod
4765	do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to rod in the entire language
4766	for days i had racked my brains
4767	there was no other rhyme
4768	the expression on his face changed
4769	the annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased
4770	a sort of intellectual warmth the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact shone through the dirt and scrubby hair
4771	has it ever occurred to you he said that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes
4772	no that particular thought had never occurred to winston
4773	nor in the circumstances did it strike him as very important or interesting
4774	do you know what time of day it is
4775	he said
4776	ampleforth looked startled again
4777	i had hardly thought about it
4778	they arrested meit could be two days agoperhaps three
4779	his eyes flitted round the walls as though he half expected to find a window somewhere
4780	there is no difference between night and day in this place
4781	i do not see how one can calculate the time
4782	they talked desultorily for some minutes then without apparent reason a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent
4783	winston sat quietly his hands crossed
4784	ampleforth too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench fidgeted from side to side clasping his lank hands first round one knee then round the other
4785	the telescreen barked at him to keep still
4786	time passed
4787	twenty minutes an hourit was difficult to judge
4788	once more there was a sound of boots outside
4789	winstons entrails contracted
4790	soon very soon perhaps in five minutes perhaps now the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come
4791	the door opened
4792	the coldfaced young officer stepped into the cell
4793	with a brief movement of the hand he indicated ampleforth
4794	room he said
4795	ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards his face vaguely perturbed but uncomprehending
4796	what seemed like a long time passed
4797	the pain in winstons belly had revived
4798	his mind sagged round and round on the same trick like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots
4799	he had only six thoughts
4800	the pain in his belly a piece of bread the blood and the screaming obrien julia the razor blade
4801	there was another spasm in his entrails the heavy boots were approaching
4802	as the door opened the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat
4803	parsons walked into the cell
4804	he was wearing khaki shorts and a sportsshirt
4805	this time winston was startled into selfforgetfulness
4806	you here
4807	he said
4808	parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise but only misery
4809	he began walking jerkily up and down evidently unable to keep still
4810	each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling
4811	his eyes had a wideopen staring look as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance
4812	what are you in for
4813	said winston
4814	thoughtcrime
4815	said parsons almost blubbering
4816	the tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself
4817	he paused opposite winston and began eagerly appealing to him you dont think theyll shoot me do you old chap
4818	they dont shoot you if you havent actually done anythingonly thoughts which you cant help
4819	i know they give you a fair hearing
4820	oh i trust them for that
4821	theyll know my record wont they
4822	you know what kind of chap i was
4823	not a bad chap in my way
4824	not brainy of course but keen
4825	i tried to do my best for the party didnt i
4826	ill get off with five years dont you think
4827	or even ten years
4828	a chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labourcamp
4829	they wouldnt shoot me for going off the rails just once
4830	are you guilty
4831	said winston
4832	of course im guilty
4833	cried parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen
4834	you dont think the party would arrest an innocent man do you
4835	his froglike face grew calmer and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression
4836	thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing old man he said sententiously
4837	its insidious
4838	it can get hold of you without your even knowing it
4839	do you know how it got hold of me
4840	in my sleep
4841	yes thats a fact
4842	there i was working away trying to do my bitnever knew i had any bad stuff in my mind at all
4843	and then i started talking in my sleep
4844	do you know what they heard me saying
4845	he sank his voice like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity
4846	down with big brother
4847	yes i said that
4848	said it over and over again it seems
4849	between you and me old man im glad they got me before it went any further
4850	do you know what im going to say to them when i go up before the tribunal
4851	thank you im going to say thank you for saving me before it was too late
4852	who denounced you
4853	said winston
4854	it was my little daughter said parsons with a sort of doleful pride
4855	she listened at the keyhole
4856	heard what i was saying and nipped off to the patrols the very next day
4857	pretty smart for a nipper of seven eh
4858	i dont bear her any grudge for it
4859	in fact im proud of her
4860	it shows i brought her up in the right spirit anyway
4861	he made a few more jerky movements up and down several times casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan
4862	then he suddenly ripped down his shorts
4863	excuse me old man he said
4864	i cant help it
4865	its the waiting
4866	he plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan
4867	winston covered his face with his hands
4868	smith
4869	yelled the voice from the telescreen
4870	smith w
4871	uncover your face
4872	no faces covered in the cells
4873	winston uncovered his face
4874	parsons used the lavatory loudly and abundantly
4875	it then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards
4876	parsons was removed
4877	more prisoners came and went mysteriously
4878	one a woman was consigned to room and winston noticed seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words
4879	a time came when if it had been morning when he was brought here it would be afternoon or if it had been afternoon then it would be midnight
4880	there were six prisoners in the cell men and women
4881	all sat very still
4882	opposite winston there sat a man with a chinless toothy face exactly like that of some large harmless rodent
4883	his fat mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there
4884	his palegrey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyones eye
4885	the door opened and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through winston
4886	he was a commonplace meanlooking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind
4887	but what was startling was the emaciation of his face
4888	it was like a skull
4889	because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous unappeasable hatred of somebody or something
4890	the man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston
4891	winston did not look at him again but the tormented skulllike face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes
4892	suddenly he realized what was the matter
4893	the man was dying of starvation
4894	the same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell
4895	there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench
4896	the eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skullfaced man then turning guiltily away then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction
4897	presently he began to fidget on his seat
4898	at last he stood up waddled clumsily across the cell dug down into the pocket of his overalls and with an abashed air held out a grimy piece of bread to the skullfaced man
4899	there was a furious deafening roar from the telescreen
4900	the chinless man jumped in his tracks
4901	the skullfaced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift
4902	bumstead
4903	roared the voice
4904	bumstead j
4905	let fall that piece of bread
4906	the chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor
4907	remain standing where you are said the voice
4908	face the door
4909	make no movement
4910	the chinless man obeyed
4911	his large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably
4912	the door clanged open
4913	as the young officer entered and stepped aside there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders
4914	he took his stand opposite the chinless man and then at a signal from the officer let free a frightful blow with all the weight of his body behind it full in the chinless mans mouth
4915	the force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor
4916	his body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat
4917	for a moment he lay as though stunned with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose
4918	a very faint whimpering or squeaking which seemed unconscious came out of him
4919	then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees
4920	amid a stream of blood and saliva the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth
4921	the prisoners sat very still their hands crossed on their knees
4922	the chinless man climbed back into his place
4923	down one side of his face the flesh was darkening
4924	his mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherrycoloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it
4925	from time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls
4926	his grey eyes still flitted from face to face more guiltily than ever as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation
4927	the door opened
4928	with a small gesture the officer indicated the skullfaced man
4929	room he said
4930	there was a gasp and a flurry at winstons side
4931	the man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor with his hand clasped together
4932	comrade
4933	officer
4934	he cried
4935	you dont have to take me to that place
4936	havent i told you everything already
4937	what else is it you want to know
4938	theres nothing i wouldnt confess nothing
4939	just tell me what it is and ill confess straight off
4940	write it down and ill sign itanything
4941	not room
4942	room said the officer
4943	the mans face already very pale turned a colour winston would not have believed possible
4944	it was definitely unmistakably a shade of green
4945	do anything to me
4946	he yelled
4947	youve been starving me for weeks
4948	finish it off and let me die
4949	shoot me
4950	hang me
4951	sentence me to twentyfive years
4952	is there somebody else you want me to give away
4953	just say who it is and ill tell you anything you want
4954	i dont care who it is or what you do to them
4955	ive got a wife and three children
4956	the biggest of them isnt six years old
4957	you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes and ill stand by and watch it
4958	but not room
4959	room said the officer
4960	the man looked frantically round at the other prisoners as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place
4961	his eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man
4962	he flung out a lean arm
4963	thats the one you ought to be taking not me
4964	he shouted
4965	you didnt hear what he was saying after they bashed his face
4966	give me a chance and ill tell you every word of it
4967	hes the one thats against the party not me
4968	the guards stepped forward
4969	the mans voice rose to a shriek
4970	you didnt hear him
4971	he repeated
4972	something went wrong with the telescreen
4973	hes the one you want
4974	take him not me
4975	the two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms
4976	but just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench
4977	he had set up a wordless howling like an animal
4978	the guards took hold of him to wrench him loose but he clung on with astonishing strength
4979	for perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him
4980	the prisoners sat quiet their hands crossed on their knees looking straight in front of them
4981	the howling stopped the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on
4982	then there was a different kind of cry
4983	a kick from a guards boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands
4984	they dragged him to his feet
4985	room said the officer
4986	the man was led out walking unsteadily with head sunken nursing his crushed hand all the fight had gone out of him
4987	a long time passed
4988	if it had been midnight when the skullfaced man was taken away it was morning if morning it was afternoon
4989	winston was alone and had been alone for hours
4990	the pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about unreproved by the telescreen
4991	the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it
4992	at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it but presently hunger gave way to thirst
4993	his mouth was sticky and eviltasting
4994	the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness an empty feeling inside his head
4995	he would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet
4996	whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned
4997	sometimes with a fading hope he thought of obrien and the razor blade
4998	it was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food if he were ever fed
4999	more dimly he thought of julia
5000	somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he
5001	she might be screaming with pain at this moment
5002	he thought if i could save julia by doubling my own pain would i do it
5003	yes i would
5004	but that was merely an intellectual decision taken because he knew that he ought to take it
5005	he did not feel it
5006	in this place you could not feel anything except pain and foreknowledge of pain
5007	besides was it possible when you were actually suffering it to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase
5008	but that question was not answerable yet
5009	the boots were approaching again
5010	the door opened
5011	obrien came in
5012	winston started to his feet
5013	the shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him
5014	for the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen
5015	theyve got you too
5016	he cried
5017	they got me a long time ago said obrien with a mild almost regretful irony
5018	he stepped aside
5019	from behind him there emerged a broadchested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand
5020	you know this winston said obrien
5021	dont deceive yourself
5022	you did know ityou have always known it
5023	yes he saw now he had always known it
5024	but there was no time to think of that
5025	all he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guards hand
5026	it might fall anywhere on the crown on the tip of the ear on the upper arm on the elbow
5027	the elbow
5028	he had slumped to his knees almost paralysed clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand
5029	everything had exploded into yellow light
5030	inconceivable inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain
5031	the light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him
5032	the guard was laughing at his contortions
5033	one question at any rate was answered
5034	never for any reason on earth could you wish for an increase of pain
5035	of pain you could wish only one thing that it should stop
5036	nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain
5037	in the face of pain there are no heroes no heroes he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm
5038	chapter
5039	he was lying on something that felt like a camp bed except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move
5040	light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face
5041	obrien was standing at his side looking down at him intently
5042	at the other side of him stood a man in a white coat holding a hypodermic syringe
5043	even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually
5044	he had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world a sort of underwater world far beneath it
5045	how long he had been down there he did not know
5046	since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight
5047	besides his memories were not continuous
5048	there had been times when consciousness even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval
5049	but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds there was no way of knowing
5050	with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started
5051	later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected
5052	there was a long range of crimesespionage sabotage and the liketo which everyone had to confess as a matter of course
5053	the confession was a formality though the torture was real
5054	how many times he had been beaten how long the beatings had continued he could not remember
5055	always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously
5056	sometimes it was fists sometimes it was truncheons sometimes it was steel rods sometimes it was boots
5057	there were times when he rolled about the floor as shameless as an animal writhing his body this way and that in an endless hopeless effort to dodge the kicks and simply inviting more and yet more kicks in his ribs in his belly on his elbows on his shins in his groin in his testicles on the bone at the base of his spine
5058	there were times when it went on and on until the cruel wicked unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness
5059	there were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes
5060	there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise when he said to himself i will confess but not yet
5061	i must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable
5062	three more kicks two more kicks and then i will tell them what they want
5063	sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell left to recuperate for a few hours and then taken out and beaten again
5064	there were also longer periods of recovery
5065	he remembered them dimly because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor
5066	he remembered a cell with a plank bed a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall and a tin washbasin and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee
5067	he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair and businesslike unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse tapping his reflexes turning up his eyelids running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep
5068	the beatings grew less frequent and became mainly a threat a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory
5069	his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles who worked on him in relays over periods which lastedhe thought he could not be sureten or twelve hours at a stretch
5070	these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on
5071	they slapped his face wrung his ears pulled his hair made him stand on one leg refused him leave to urinate shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning
5072	their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on hour after hour tripping him up laying traps for him twisting everything that he said convicting him at every step of lies and selfcontradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue
5073	sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session
5074	most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune call him comrade appeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done
5075	when his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears
5076	in the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards
5077	he became simply a mouth that uttered a hand that signed whatever was demanded of him
5078	his sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess and then confess it quickly before the bullying started anew
5079	he confessed to the assassination of eminent party members the distribution of seditious pamphlets embezzlement of public funds sale of military secrets sabotage of every kind
5080	he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as
5081	he confessed that he was a religious believer an admirer of capitalism and a sexual pervert
5082	he confessed that he had murdered his wife although he knew and his questioners must have known that his wife was still alive
5083	he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known
5084	it was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody
5085	besides in a sense it was all true
5086	it was true that he had been the enemy of the party and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed
5087	there were also memories of another kind
5088	they stood out in his mind disconnectedly like pictures with blackness all round them
5089	he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes
5090	near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly
5091	the eyes grew larger and more luminous
5092	suddenly he floated out of his seat dived into the eyes and was swallowed up
5093	he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials under dazzling lights
5094	a man in a white coat was reading the dials
5095	there was a tramp of heavy boots outside
5096	the door clanged open
5097	the waxedfaced officer marched in followed by two guards
5098	room said the officer
5099	the man in the white coat did not turn round
5100	he did not look at winston either he was looking only at the dials
5101	he was rolling down a mighty corridor a kilometre wide full of glorious golden light roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice
5102	he was confessing everything even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture
5103	he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already
5104	with him were the guards the other questioners the men in white coats obrien julia mr charrington all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter
5105	some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened
5106	everything was all right there was no more pain the last detail of his life was laid bare understood forgiven
5107	he was starting up from the plank bed in the halfcertainty that he had heard obriens voice
5108	all through his interrogation although he had never seen him he had had the feeling that obrien was at his elbow just out of sight
5109	it was obrien who was directing everything
5110	it was he who set the guards on to winston and who prevented them from killing him
5111	it was he who decided when winston should scream with pain when he should have a respite when he should be fed when he should sleep when the drugs should be pumped into his arm
5112	it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers
5113	he was the tormentor he was the protector he was the inquisitor he was the friend
5114	and oncewinston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep or in normal sleep or even in a moment of wakefulnessa voice murmured in his ear dont worry winston you are in my keeping
5115	for seven years i have watched over you
5116	now the turningpoint has come
5117	i shall save you i shall make you perfect
5118	he was not sure whether it was obriens voice but it was the same voice that had said to him we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness in that other dream seven years ago
5119	he did not remember any ending to his interrogation
5120	there was a period of blackness and then the cell or room in which he now was had gradually materialized round him
5121	he was almost flat on his back and unable to move
5122	his body was held down at every essential point
5123	even the back of his head was gripped in some manner
5124	obrien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly
5125	his face seen from below looked coarse and worn with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin
5126	he was older than winston had thought him he was perhaps fortyeight or fifty
5127	under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face
5128	i told you said obrien that if we met again it would be here
5129	yes said winston
5130	without any warning except a slight movement of obriens hand a wave of pain flooded his body
5131	it was a frightening pain because he could not see what was happening and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him
5132	he did not know whether the thing was really happening or whether the effect was electrically produced but his body was being wrenched out of shape the joints were being slowly torn apart
5133	although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap
5134	he set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose trying to keep silent as long as possible
5135	you are afraid said obrien watching his face that in another moment something is going to break
5136	your especial fear is that it will be your backbone
5137	you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them
5138	that is what you are thinking is it not winston
5139	winston did not answer
5140	obrien drew back the lever on the dial
5141	the wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come
5142	that was forty said obrien
5143	you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred
5144	will you please remember throughout our conversation that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose
5145	if you tell me any lies or attempt to prevaricate in any way or even fall below your usual level of intelligence you will cry out with pain instantly
5146	do you understand that
5147	yes said winston
5148	obriens manner became less severe
5149	he resettled his spectacles thoughtfully and took a pace or two up and down
5150	when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient
5151	he had the air of a doctor a teacher even a priest anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish
5152	i am taking trouble with you winston he said because you are worth trouble
5153	you know perfectly well what is the matter with you
5154	you have known it for years though you have fought against the knowledge
5155	you are mentally deranged
5156	you suffer from a defective memory
5157	you are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened
5158	fortunately it is curable
5159	you have never cured yourself of it because you did not choose to
5160	there was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make
5161	even now i am well aware you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue
5162	now we will take an example
5163	at this moment which power is oceania at war with
5164	when i was arrested oceania was at war with eastasia
5165	with eastasia
5166	good
5167	and oceania has always been at war with eastasia has it not
5168	winston drew in his breath
5169	he opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak
5170	he could not take his eyes away from the dial
5171	the truth please winston
5172	your truth
5173	tell me what you think you remember
5174	i remember that until only a week before i was arrested we were not at war with eastasia at all
5175	we were in alliance with them
5176	the war was against eurasia
5177	that had lasted for four years
5178	before that
5179	obrien stopped him with a movement of the hand
5180	another example he said
5181	some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed
5182	you believed that three men three onetime party members named jones aaronson and rutherfordmen who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confessionwere not guilty of the crimes they were charged with
5183	you believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false
5184	there was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination
5185	you believed that you had actually held it in your hands
5186	it was a photograph something like this
5187	an oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between obriens fingers
5188	for perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winstons vision
5189	it was a photograph and there was no question of its identity
5190	it was the photograph
5191	it was another copy of the photograph of jones aaronson and rutherford at the party function in new york which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed
5192	for only an instant it was before his eyes then it was out of sight again
5193	but he had seen it unquestionably he had seen it
5194	he made a desperate agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free
5195	it was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction
5196	for the moment he had even forgotten the dial
5197	all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again or at least to see it
5198	it exists
5199	he cried
5200	no said obrien
5201	he stepped across the room
5202	there was a memory hole in the opposite wall
5203	obrien lifted the grating
5204	unseen the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air it was vanishing in a flash of flame
5205	obrien turned away from the wall
5206	ashes he said
5207	not even identifiable ashes
5208	dust
5209	it does not exist
5210	it never existed
5211	but it did exist
5212	it does exist
5213	it exists in memory
5214	i remember it
5215	you remember it
5216	i do not remember it said obrien
5217	winstons heart sank
5218	that was doublethink
5219	he had a feeling of deadly helplessness
5220	if he could have been certain that obrien was lying it would not have seemed to matter
5221	but it was perfectly possible that obrien had really forgotten the photograph
5222	and if so then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it and forgotten the act of forgetting
5223	how could one be sure that it was simple trickery
5224	perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen that was the thought that defeated him
5225	obrien was looking down at him speculatively
5226	more than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child
5227	there is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past he said
5228	repeat it if you please
5229	who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past repeated winston obediently
5230	who controls the present controls the past said obrien nodding his head with slow approval
5231	is it your opinion winston that the past has real existence
5232	again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston
5233	his eyes flitted towards the dial
5234	he not only did not know whether yes or no was the answer that would save him from pain he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one
5235	obrien smiled faintly
5236	you are no metaphysician winston he said
5237	until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence
5238	i will put it more precisely
5239	does the past exist concretely in space
5240	is there somewhere or other a place a world of solid objects where the past is still happening
5241	no
5242	then where does the past exist if at all
5243	in records
5244	it is written down
5245	in records
5246	and
5247	in the mind
5248	in human memories
5249	in memory
5250	very well then
5251	we the party control all records and we control all memories
5252	then we control the past do we not
5253	but how can you stop people remembering things
5254	cried winston again momentarily forgetting the dial
5255	it is involuntary
5256	it is outside oneself
5257	how can you control memory
5258	you have not controlled mine
5259	obriens manner grew stern again
5260	he laid his hand on the dial
5261	on the contrary he said you have not controlled it
5262	that is what has brought you here
5263	you are here because you have failed in humility in selfdiscipline
5264	you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity
5265	you preferred to be a lunatic a minority of one
5266	only the disciplined mind can see reality winston
5267	you believe that reality is something objective external existing in its own right
5268	you also believe that the nature of reality is selfevident
5269	when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you
5270	but i tell you winston that reality is not external
5271	reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else
5272	not in the individual mind which can make mistakes and in any case soon perishes only in the mind of the party which is collective and immortal
5273	whatever the party holds to be the truth is truth
5274	it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party
5275	that is the fact that you have got to relearn winston
5276	it needs an act of selfdestruction an effort of the will
5277	you must humble yourself before you can become sane
5278	he paused for a few moments as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in
5279	do you remember he went on writing in your diary freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four
5280	yes said winston
5281	obrien held up his left hand its back towards winston with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended
5282	how many fingers am i holding up winston
5283	four
5284	and if the party says that it is not four but fivethen how many
5285	four
5286	the word ended in a gasp of pain
5287	the needle of the dial had shot up to fiftyfive
5288	the sweat had sprung out all over winstons body
5289	the air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop
5290	obrien watched him the four fingers still extended
5291	he drew back the lever
5292	this time the pain was only slightly eased
5293	how many fingers winston
5294	four
5295	the needle went up to sixty
5296	how many fingers winston
5297	four
5298	four
5299	what else can i say
5300	four
5301	the needle must have risen again but he did not look at it
5302	the heavy stern face and the four fingers filled his vision
5303	the fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars enormous blurry and seeming to vibrate but unmistakably four
5304	how many fingers winston
5305	four
5306	stop it stop it
5307	how can you go on
5308	four
5309	four
5310	how many fingers winston
5311	five
5312	five
5313	five
5314	no winston that is no use
5315	you are lying
5316	you still think there are four
5317	how many fingers please
5318	four
5319	five
5320	four
5321	anything you like
5322	only stop it stop the pain
5323	abruptly he was sitting up with obriens arm round his shoulders
5324	he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds
5325	the bonds that had held his body down were loosened
5326	he felt very cold he was shaking uncontrollably his teeth were chattering the tears were rolling down his cheeks
5327	for a moment he clung to obrien like a baby curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders
5328	he had the feeling that obrien was his protector that the pain was something that came from outside from some other source and that it was obrien who would save him from it
5329	you are a slow learner winston said obrien gently
5330	how can i help it
5331	he blubbered
5332	how can i help seeing what is in front of my eyes
5333	two and two are four
5334	sometimes winston
5335	sometimes they are five
5336	sometimes they are three
5337	sometimes they are all of them at once
5338	you must try harder
5339	it is not easy to become sane
5340	he laid winston down on the bed
5341	the grip of his limbs tightened again but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped leaving him merely weak and cold
5342	obrien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings
5343	the man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into winstons eyes felt his pulse laid an ear against his chest tapped here and there then he nodded to obrien
5344	again said obrien
5345	the pain flowed into winstons body
5346	the needle must be at seventy seventyfive
5347	he had shut his eyes this time
5348	he knew that the fingers were still there and still four
5349	all that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over
5350	he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not
5351	the pain lessened again
5352	he opened his eyes
5353	obrien had drawn back the lever
5354	how many fingers winston
5355	four
5356	i suppose there are four
5357	i would see five if i could
5358	i am trying to see five
5359	which do you wish to persuade me that you see five or really to see them
5360	really to see them
5361	again said obrien
5362	perhaps the needle was eightyninety
5363	winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening
5364	behind his screwedup eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance weaving in and out disappearing behind one another and reappearing again
5365	he was trying to count them he could not remember why
5366	he knew only that it was impossible to count them and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four
5367	the pain died down again
5368	when he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing
5369	innumerable fingers like moving trees were still streaming past in either direction crossing and recrossing
5370	he shut his eyes again
5371	how many fingers am i holding up winston
5372	i dont know
5373	i dont know
5374	you will kill me if you do that again
5375	four five sixin all honesty i dont know
5376	better said obrien
5377	a needle slid into winstons arm
5378	almost in the same instant a blissful healing warmth spread all through his body
5379	the pain was already halfforgotten
5380	he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at obrien
5381	at sight of the heavy lined face so ugly and so intelligent his heart seemed to turn over
5382	if he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on obriens arm
5383	he had never loved him so deeply as at this moment and not merely because he had stopped the pain
5384	the old feeling that at bottom it did not matter whether obrien was a friend or an enemy had come back
5385	obrien was a person who could be talked to
5386	perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood
5387	obrien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy and in a little while it was certain he would send him to his death
5388	it made no difference
5389	in some sense that went deeper than friendship they were intimates somewhere or other although the actual words might never be spoken there was a place where they could meet and talk
5390	obrien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind
5391	when he spoke it was in an easy conversational tone
5392	do you know where you are winston
5393	he said
5394	i dont know
5395	i can guess
5396	in the ministry of love
5397	do you know how long you have been here
5398	i dont know
5399	days weeks monthsi think it is months
5400	and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place
5401	to make them confess
5402	no that is not the reason
5403	try again
5404	to punish them
5405	no
5406	exclaimed obrien
5407	his voice had changed extraordinarily and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated
5408	no
5409	not merely to extract your confession not to punish you
5410	shall i tell you why we have brought you here
5411	to cure you
5412	to make you sane
5413	will you understand winston that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured
5414	we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed
5415	the party is not interested in the overt act the thought is all we care about
5416	we do not merely destroy our enemies we change them
5417	do you understand what i mean by that
5418	he was bending over winston
5419	his face looked enormous because of its nearness and hideously ugly because it was seen from below
5420	moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation a lunatic intensity
5421	again winstons heart shrank
5422	if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed
5423	he felt certain that obrien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness
5424	at this moment however obrien turned away
5425	he took a pace or two up and down
5426	then he continued less vehemently
5427	the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms
5428	you have read of the religious persecutions of the past
5429	in the middle ages there was the inquisition
5430	it was a failure
5431	it set out to eradicate heresy and ended by perpetuating it
5432	for every heretic it burned at the stake thousands of others rose up
5433	why was that
5434	because the inquisition killed its enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant in fact it killed them because they were unrepentant
5435	men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs
5436	naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him
5437	later in the twentieth century there were the totalitarians as they were called
5438	there were the german nazis and the russian communists
5439	the russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the inquisition had done
5440	and they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past they knew at any rate that one must not make martyrs
5441	before they exposed their victims to public trial they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity
5442	they wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable cringing wretches confessing whatever was put into their mouths covering themselves with abuse accusing and sheltering behind one another whimpering for mercy
5443	and yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again
5444	the dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten
5445	once again why was it
5446	in the first place because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue
5447	we do not make mistakes of that kind
5448	all the confessions that are uttered here are true
5449	we make them true
5450	and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us
5451	you must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you winston
5452	posterity will never hear of you
5453	you will be lifted clean out from the stream of history
5454	we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere
5455	nothing will remain of you not a name in a register not a memory in a living brain
5456	you will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future
5457	you will never have existed
5458	then why bother to torture me
5459	thought winston with a momentary bitterness
5460	obrien checked his step as though winston had uttered the thought aloud
5461	his large ugly face came nearer with the eyes a little narrowed
5462	you are thinking he said that since we intend to destroy you utterly so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest differencein that case why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first
5463	that is what you were thinking was it not
5464	yes said winston
5465	obrien smiled slightly
5466	you are a flaw in the pattern winston
5467	you are a stain that must be wiped out
5468	did i not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past
5469	we are not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission
5470	when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will
5471	we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him
5472	we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him
5473	we burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul
5474	we make him one of ourselves before we kill him
5475	it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be
5476	even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation
5477	in the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic proclaiming his heresy exulting in it
5478	even the victim of the russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet
5479	but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
5480	the command of the old despotisms was thou shalt not
5481	the command of the totalitarians was thou shalt
5482	our command is thou art
5483	no one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us
5484	everyone is washed clean
5485	even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believedjones aaronson and rutherfordin the end we broke them down
5486	i took part in their interrogation myself
5487	i saw them gradually worn down whimpering grovelling weepingand in the end it was not with pain or fear only with penitence
5488	by the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men
5489	there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done and love of big brother
5490	it was touching to see how they loved him
5491	they begged to be shot quickly so that they could die while their minds were still clean
5492	his voice had grown almost dreamy
5493	the exaltation the lunatic enthusiasm was still in his face
5494	he is not pretending thought winston he is not a hypocrite he believes every word he says
5495	what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority
5496	he watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro in and out of the range of his vision
5497	obrien was a being in all ways larger than himself
5498	there was no idea that he had ever had or could have that obrien had not long ago known examined and rejected
5499	his mind contained winstons mind
5500	but in that case how could it be true that obrien was mad
5501	it must be he winston who was mad
5502	obrien halted and looked down at him
5503	his voice had grown stern again
5504	do not imagine that you will save yourself winston however completely you surrender to us
5505	no one who has once gone astray is ever spared
5506	and even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life still you would never escape from us
5507	what happens to you here is for ever
5508	understand that in advance
5509	we shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back
5510	things will happen to you from which you could not recover if you lived a thousand years
5511	never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling
5512	everything will be dead inside you
5513	never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity
5514	you will be hollow
5515	we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves
5516	he paused and signed to the man in the white coat
5517	winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head
5518	obrien had sat down beside the bed so that his face was almost on a level with winstons
5519	three thousand he said speaking over winstons head to the man in the white coat
5520	two soft pads which felt slightly moist clamped themselves against winstons temples
5521	he quailed
5522	there was pain coming a new kind of pain
5523	obrien laid a hand reassuringly almost kindly on his
5524	this time it will not hurt he said
5525	keep your eyes fixed on mine
5526	at this moment there was a devastating explosion or what seemed like an explosion though it was not certain whether there was any noise
5527	there was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light
5528	winston was not hurt only prostrated
5529	although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position
5530	a terrific painless blow had flattened him out
5531	also something had happened inside his head
5532	as his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was and where he was and recognized the face that was gazing into his own but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness as though a piece had been taken out of his brain
5533	it will not last said obrien
5534	look me in the eyes
5535	what country is oceania at war with
5536	winston thought
5537	he knew what was meant by oceania and that he himself was a citizen of oceania
5538	he also remembered eurasia and eastasia but who was at war with whom he did not know
5539	in fact he had not been aware that there was any war
5540	i dont remember
5541	oceania is at war with eastasia
5542	do you remember that now
5543	yes
5544	oceania has always been at war with eastasia
5545	since the beginning of your life since the beginning of the party since the beginning of history the war has continued without a break always the same war
5546	do you remember that
5547	yes
5548	eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery
5549	you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent
5550	no such piece of paper ever existed
5551	you invented it and later you grew to believe in it
5552	you remember now the very moment at which you first invented it
5553	do you remember that
5554	yes
5555	just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you
5556	you saw five fingers
5557	do you remember that
5558	yes
5559	obrien held up the fingers of his left hand with the thumb concealed
5560	there are five fingers there
5561	do you see five fingers
5562	yes
5563	and he did see them for a fleeting instant before the scenery of his mind changed
5564	he saw five fingers and there was no deformity
5565	then everything was normal again and the old fear the hatred and the bewilderment came crowding back again
5566	but there had been a momenthe did not know how long thirty seconds perhapsof luminous certainty when each new suggestion of obriens had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth and when two and two could have been three as easily as five if that were what was needed
5567	it had faded but before obrien had dropped his hand but though he could not recapture it he could remember it as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of ones life when one was in effect a different person
5568	you see now said obrien that it is at any rate possible
5569	yes said winston
5570	obrien stood up with a satisfied air
5571	over to his left winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe
5572	obrien turned to winston with a smile
5573	in almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose
5574	do you remember writing in your diary he said that it did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy since i was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to
5575	you were right
5576	i enjoy talking to you
5577	your mind appeals to me
5578	it resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane
5579	before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions if you choose
5580	any question i like
5581	anything
5582	he saw that winstons eyes were upon the dial
5583	it is switched off
5584	what is your first question
5585	what have you done with julia
5586	said winston
5587	obrien smiled again
5588	she betrayed you winston
5589	immediatelyunreservedly
5590	i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly
5591	you would hardly recognize her if you saw her
5592	all her rebelliousness her deceit her folly her dirtymindednesseverything has been burned out of her
5593	it was a perfect conversion a textbook case
5594	you tortured her
5595	obrien left this unanswered
5596	next question he said
5597	does big brother exist
5598	of course he exists
5599	the party exists
5600	big brother is the embodiment of the party
5601	does he exist in the same way as i exist
5602	you do not exist said obrien
5603	once again the sense of helplessness assailed him
5604	he knew or he could imagine the arguments which proved his own nonexistence but they were nonsense they were only a play on words
5605	did not the statement you do not exist contain a logical absurdity
5606	but what use was it to say so
5607	his mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable mad arguments with which obrien would demolish him
5608	i think i exist he said wearily
5609	i am conscious of my own identity
5610	i was born and i shall die
5611	i have arms and legs
5612	i occupy a particular point in space
5613	no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously
5614	in that sense does big brother exist
5615	it is of no importance
5616	he exists
5617	will big brother ever die
5618	of course not
5619	how could he die
5620	next question
5621	does the brotherhood exist
5622	that winston you will never know
5623	if we choose to set you free when we have finished with you and if you live to be ninety years old still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no
5624	as long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind
5625	winston lay silent
5626	his breast rose and fell a little faster
5627	he still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first
5628	he had got to ask it and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it
5629	there was a trace of amusement in obriens face
5630	even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam
5631	he knows thought winston suddenly he knows what i am going to ask
5632	at the thought the words burst out of him
5633	what is in room
5634	the expression on obriens face did not change
5635	he answered drily
5636	you know what is in room winston
5637	everyone knows what is in room
5638	he raised a finger to the man in the white coat
5639	evidently the session was at an end
5640	a needle jerked into winstons arm
5641	he sank almost instantly into deep sleep
5642	chapter
5643	there are three stages in your reintegration said obrien
5644	there is learning there is understanding and there is acceptance
5645	it is time for you to enter upon the second stage
5646	as always winston was lying flat on his back
5647	but of late his bonds were looser
5648	they still held him to the bed but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow
5649	the dial also had grown to be less of a terror
5650	he could evade its pangs if he was quickwitted enough it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that obrien pulled the lever
5651	sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial
5652	he could not remember how many sessions there had been
5653	the whole process seemed to stretch out over a long indefinite timeweeks possiblyand the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days sometimes only an hour or two
5654	as you lie there said obrien you have often wonderedyou have even asked mewhy the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble on you
5655	and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question
5656	you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in but not its underlying motives
5657	do you remember writing in your diary i understand how i do not understand why
5658	it was when you thought about why that you doubted your own sanity
5659	you have read the book goldsteins book or parts of it at least
5660	did it tell you anything that you did not know already
5661	you have read it
5662	said winston
5663	i wrote it
5664	that is to say i collaborated in writing it
5665	no book is produced individually as you know
5666	is it true what it says
5667	as description yes
5668	the programme it sets forth is nonsense
5669	the secret accumulation of knowledgea gradual spread of enlightenmentultimately a proletarian rebellionthe overthrow of the party
5670	you foresaw yourself that that was what it would say
5671	it is all nonsense
5672	the proletarians will never revolt not in a thousand years or a million
5673	they cannot
5674	i do not have to tell you the reason you know it already
5675	if you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection you must abandon them
5676	there is no way in which the party can be overthrown
5677	the rule of the party is for ever
5678	make that the startingpoint of your thoughts
5679	he came closer to the bed
5680	for ever
5681	he repeated
5682	and now let us get back to the question of how and why
5683	you understand well enough how the party maintains itself in power
5684	now tell me why we cling to power
5685	what is our motive
5686	why should we want power
5687	go on speak he added as winston remained silent
5688	nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two
5689	a feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him
5690	the faint mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into obriens face
5691	he knew in advance what obrien would say
5692	that the party did not seek power for its own ends but only for the good of the majority
5693	that it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves
5694	that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness and that for the great bulk of mankind happiness was better
5695	that the party was the eternal guardian of the weak a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come sacrificing its own happiness to that of others
5696	the terrible thing thought winston the terrible thing was that when obrien said this he would believe it
5697	you could see it in his face
5698	obrien knew everything
5699	a thousand times better than winston he knew what the world was really like in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there
5700	he had understood it all weighed it all and it made no difference all was justified by the ultimate purpose
5701	what can you do thought winston against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy
5702	you are ruling over us for our own good he said feebly
5703	you believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves and therefore
5704	he started and almost cried out
5705	a pang of pain had shot through his body
5706	obrien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirtyfive
5707	that was stupid winston stupid
5708	he said
5709	you should know better than to say a thing like that
5710	he pulled the lever back and continued
5711	now i will tell you the answer to my question
5712	it is this
5713	the party seeks power entirely for its own sake
5714	we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power
5715	not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power
5716	what pure power means you will understand presently
5717	we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing
5718	all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites
5719	the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives
5720	they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal
5721	we are not like that
5722	we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it
5723	power is not a means it is an end
5724	one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship
5725	the object of persecution is persecution
5726	the object of torture is torture
5727	the object of power is power
5728	now do you begin to understand me
5729	winston was struck as he had been struck before by the tiredness of obriens face
5730	it was strong and fleshy and brutal it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless but it was tired
5731	there were pouches under the eyes the skin sagged from the cheekbones
5732	obrien leaned over him deliberately bringing the worn face nearer
5733	you are thinking he said that my face is old and tired
5734	you are thinking that i talk of power and yet i am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body
5735	can you not understand winston that the individual is only a cell
5736	the weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism
5737	do you die when you cut your fingernails
5738	he turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again one hand in his pocket
5739	we are the priests of power he said
5740	god is power
5741	but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned
5742	it is time for you to gather some idea of what power means
5743	the first thing you must realize is that power is collective
5744	the individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual
5745	you know the party slogan freedom is slavery
5746	has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible
5747	slavery is freedom
5748	alonefreethe human being is always defeated
5749	it must be so because every human being is doomed to die which is the greatest of all failures
5750	but if he can make complete utter submission if he can escape from his identity if he can merge himself in the party so that he is the party then he is allpowerful and immortal
5751	the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings
5752	over the bodybut above all over the mind
5753	power over matterexternal reality as you would call itis not important
5754	already our control over matter is absolute
5755	for a moment winston ignored the dial
5756	he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully
5757	but how can you control matter
5758	he burst out
5759	you dont even control the climate or the law of gravity
5760	and there are disease pain death
5761	obrien silenced him by a movement of his hand
5762	we control matter because we control the mind
5763	reality is inside the skull
5764	you will learn by degrees winston
5765	there is nothing that we could not do
5766	invisibility levitationanything
5767	i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wish to
5768	i do not wish to because the party does not wish it
5769	you must get rid of those nineteenthcentury ideas about the laws of nature
5770	we make the laws of nature
5771	but you do not
5772	you are not even masters of this planet
5773	what about eurasia and eastasia
5774	you have not conquered them yet
5775	unimportant
5776	we shall conquer them when it suits us
5777	and if we did not what difference would it make
5778	we can shut them out of existence
5779	oceania is the world
5780	but the world itself is only a speck of dust
5781	and man is tinyhelpless
5782	how long has he been in existence
5783	for millions of years the earth was uninhabited
5784	nonsense
5785	the earth is as old as we are no older
5786	how could it be older
5787	nothing exists except through human consciousness
5788	but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animalsmammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of
5789	have you ever seen those bones winston
5790	of course not
5791	nineteenthcentury biologists invented them
5792	before man there was nothing
5793	after man if he could come to an end there would be nothing
5794	outside man there is nothing
5795	but the whole universe is outside us
5796	look at the stars
5797	some of them are a million lightyears away
5798	they are out of our reach for ever
5799	what are the stars
5800	said obrien indifferently
5801	they are bits of fire a few kilometres away
5802	we could reach them if we wanted to
5803	or we could blot them out
5804	the earth is the centre of the universe
5805	the sun and the stars go round it
5806	winston made another convulsive movement
5807	this time he did not say anything
5808	obrien continued as though answering a spoken objection
5809	for certain purposes of course that is not true
5810	when we navigate the ocean or when we predict an eclipse we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away
5811	but what of it
5812	do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy
5813	the stars can be near or distant according as we need them
5814	do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that
5815	have you forgotten doublethink
5816	winston shrank back upon the bed
5817	whatever he said the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon
5818	and yet he knew he knew that he was in the right
5819	the belief that nothing exists outside your own mindsurely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false
5820	had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy
5821	there was even a name for it which he had forgotten
5822	a faint smile twitched the corners of obriens mouth as he looked down at him
5823	i told you winston he said that metaphysics is not your strong point
5824	the word you are trying to think of is solipsism
5825	but you are mistaken
5826	this is not solipsism
5827	collective solipsism if you like
5828	but that is a different thing in fact the opposite thing
5829	all this is a digression he added in a different tone
5830	the real power the power we have to fight for night and day is not power over things but over men
5831	he paused and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil how does one man assert his power over another winston
5832	winston thought
5833	by making him suffer he said
5834	exactly
5835	by making him suffer
5836	obedience is not enough
5837	unless he is suffering how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own
5838	power is in inflicting pain and humiliation
5839	power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing
5840	do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating
5841	it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined
5842	a world of fear and treachery and torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself
5843	progress in our world will be progress towards more pain
5844	the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice
5845	ours is founded upon hatred
5846	in our world there will be no emotions except fear rage triumph and selfabasement
5847	everything else we shall destroyeverything
5848	already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution
5849	we have cut the links between child and parent and between man and man and between man and woman
5850	no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer
5851	but in the future there will be no wives and no friends
5852	children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen
5853	the sex instinct will be eradicated
5854	procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card
5855	we shall abolish the orgasm
5856	our neurologists are at work upon it now
5857	there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party
5858	there will be no love except the love of big brother
5859	there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy
5860	there will be no art no literature no science
5861	when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science
5862	there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness
5863	there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life
5864	all competing pleasures will be destroyed
5865	but alwaysdo not forget this winstonalways there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler
5866	always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless
5867	if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human facefor ever
5868	he paused as though he expected winston to speak
5869	winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again
5870	he could not say anything
5871	his heart seemed to be frozen
5872	obrien went on
5873	and remember that it is for ever
5874	the face will always be there to be stamped upon
5875	the heretic the enemy of society will always be there so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again
5876	everything that you have undergone since you have been in our handsall that will continue and worse
5877	the espionage the betrayals the arrests the tortures the executions the disappearances will never cease
5878	it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph
5879	the more the party is powerful the less it will be tolerant the weaker the opposition the tighter the despotism
5880	goldstein and his heresies will live for ever
5881	every day at every moment they will be defeated discredited ridiculed spat upon and yet they will always survive
5882	this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation always in subtler forms
5883	always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy screaming with pain broken up contemptibleand in the end utterly penitent saved from himself crawling to our feet of his own accord
5884	that is the world that we are preparing winston
5885	a world of victory after victory triumph after triumph after triumph an endless pressing pressing pressing upon the nerve of power
5886	you are beginning i can see to realize what that world will be like
5887	but in the end you will do more than understand it
5888	you will accept it welcome it become part of it
5889	winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak
5890	you cant
5891	he said weakly
5892	what do you mean by that remark winston
5893	you could not create such a world as you have just described
5894	it is a dream
5895	it is impossible
5896	why
5897	it is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty
5898	it would never endure
5899	why not
5900	it would have no vitality
5901	it would disintegrate
5902	it would commit suicide
5903	nonsense
5904	you are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love
5905	why should it be
5906	and if it were what difference would that make
5907	suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster
5908	suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty
5909	still what difference would it make
5910	can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death
5911	the party is immortal
5912	as usual the voice had battered winston into helplessness
5913	moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement obrien would twist the dial again
5914	and yet he could not keep silent
5915	feebly without arguments with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what obrien had said he returned to the attack
5916	i dont knowi dont care
5917	somehow you will fail
5918	something will defeat you
5919	life will defeat you
5920	we control life winston at all its levels
5921	you are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us
5922	but we create human nature
5923	men are infinitely malleable
5924	or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us
5925	put it out of your mind
5926	they are helpless like the animals
5927	humanity is the party
5928	the others are outsideirrelevant
5929	i dont care
5930	in the end they will beat you
5931	sooner or later they will see you for what you are and then they will tear you to pieces
5932	do you see any evidence that that is happening
5933	or any reason why it should
5934	no
5935	i believe it
5936	i know that you will fail
5937	there is something in the universei dont know some spirit some principlethat you will never overcome
5938	do you believe in god winston
5939	no
5940	then what is it this principle that will defeat us
5941	i dont know
5942	the spirit of man
5943	and do you consider yourself a man
5944	yes
5945	if you are a man winston you are the last man
5946	your kind is extinct we are the inheritors
5947	do you understand that you are alone
5948	you are outside history you are nonexistent
5949	his manner changed and he said more harshly and you consider yourself morally superior to us with our lies and our cruelty
5950	yes i consider myself superior
5951	obrien did not speak
5952	two other voices were speaking
5953	after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own
5954	it was a soundtrack of the conversation he had had with obrien on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood
5955	he heard himself promising to lie to steal to forge to murder to encourage drugtaking and prostitution to disseminate venereal diseases to throw vitriol in a childs face
5956	obrien made a small impatient gesture as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making
5957	then he turned a switch and the voices stopped
5958	get up from that bed he said
5959	the bonds had loosened themselves
5960	winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily
5961	you are the last man said obrien
5962	you are the guardian of the human spirit
5963	you shall see yourself as you are
5964	take off your clothes
5965	winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together
5966	the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them
5967	he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time
5968	beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes
5969	as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a threesided mirror at the far end of the room
5970	he approached it then stopped short
5971	an involuntary cry had broken out of him
5972	go on said obrien
5973	stand between the wings of the mirror
5974	you shall see the side view as well
5975	he had stopped because he was frightened
5976	a bowed greycoloured skeletonlike thing was coming towards him
5977	its actual appearance was frightening and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself
5978	he moved closer to the glass
5979	the creatures face seemed to be protruded because of its bent carriage
5980	a forlorn jailbirds face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp a crooked nose and batteredlooking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful
5981	the cheeks were seamed the mouth had a drawnin look
5982	certainly it was his own face but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside
5983	the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt
5984	he had gone partially bald
5985	for the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well but it was only the scalp that was grey
5986	except for his hands and a circle of his face his body was grey all over with ancient ingrained dirt
5987	here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it
5988	but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body
5989	the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs
5990	he saw now what obrien had meant about seeing the side view
5991	the curvature of the spine was astonishing
5992	the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull
5993	at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty suffering from some malignant disease
5994	you have thought sometimes said obrien that my facethe face of a member of the inner partylooks old and worn
5995	what do you think of your own face
5996	he seized winstons shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him
5997	look at the condition you are in
5998	he said
5999	look at this filthy grime all over your body
6000	look at the dirt between your toes
6001	look at that disgusting running sore on your leg
6002	do you know that you stink like a goat
6003	probably you have ceased to notice it
6004	look at your emaciation
6005	do you see
6006	i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep
6007	i could snap your neck like a carrot
6008	do you know that you have lost twentyfive kilograms since you have been in our hands
6009	even your hair is coming out in handfuls
6010	look
6011	he plucked at winstons head and brought away a tuft of hair
6012	open your mouth
6013	nine ten eleven teeth left
6014	how many had you when you came to us
6015	and the few you have left are dropping out of your head
6016	look here
6017	he seized one of winstons remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger
6018	a twinge of pain shot through winstons jaw
6019	obrien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots
6020	he tossed it across the cell
6021	you are rotting away he said you are falling to pieces
6022	what are you
6023	a bag of filth
6024	now turn around and look into that mirror again
6025	do you see that thing facing you
6026	that is the last man
6027	if you are human that is humanity
6028	now put your clothes on again
6029	winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements
6030	until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was
6031	only one thought stirred in his mind that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined
6032	then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him
6033	before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears
6034	he was aware of his ugliness his gracelessness a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light but he could not stop himself
6035	obrien laid a hand on his shoulder almost kindly
6036	it will not last for ever he said
6037	you can escape from it whenever you choose
6038	everything depends on yourself
6039	you did it
6040	sobbed winston
6041	you reduced me to this state
6042	no winston you reduced yourself to it
6043	this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party
6044	it was all contained in that first act
6045	nothing has happened that you did not foresee
6046	he paused and then went on
6047	we have beaten you winston
6048	we have broken you up
6049	you have seen what your body is like
6050	your mind is in the same state
6051	i do not think there can be much pride left in you
6052	you have been kicked and flogged and insulted you have screamed with pain you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit
6053	you have whimpered for mercy you have betrayed everybody and everything
6054	can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you
6055	winston had stopped weeping though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes
6056	he looked up at obrien
6057	i have not betrayed julia he said
6058	obrien looked down at him thoughtfully
6059	no he said no that is perfectly true
6060	you have not betrayed julia
6061	the peculiar reverence for obrien which nothing seemed able to destroy flooded winstons heart again
6062	how intelligent he thought how intelligent
6063	never did obrien fail to understand what was said to him
6064	anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia
6065	for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture
6066	he had told them everything he knew about her her habits her character her past life he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings all that he had said to her and she to him their blackmarket meals their adulteries their vague plottings against the partyeverything
6067	and yet in the sense in which he intended the word he had not betrayed her
6068	he had not stopped loving her his feelings towards her had remained the same
6069	obrien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation
6070	tell me he said how soon will they shoot me
6071	it might be a long time said obrien
6072	you are a difficult case
6073	but dont give up hope
6074	everyone is cured sooner or later
6075	in the end we shall shoot you
6076	chapter
6077	he was much better
6078	he was growing fatter and stronger every day if it was proper to speak of days
6079	the white light and the humming sound were the same as ever but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in
6080	there was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed and a stool to sit on
6081	they had given him a bath and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin
6082	they even gave him warm water to wash with
6083	they had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls
6084	they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment
6085	they had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures
6086	weeks or months must have passed
6087	it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time if he had felt any interest in doing so since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals
6088	he was getting he judged three meals in the twentyfour hours sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day
6089	the food was surprisingly good with meat at every third meal
6090	once there was even a packet of cigarettes
6091	he had no matches but the neverspeaking guard who brought his food would give him a light
6092	the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick but he persevered and spun the packet out for a long time smoking half a cigarette after each meal
6093	they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner
6094	at first he made no use of it
6095	even when he was awake he was completely torpid
6096	often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring sometimes asleep sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes
6097	he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face
6098	it seemed to make no difference except that ones dreams were more coherent
6099	he dreamed a great deal all through this time and they were always happy dreams
6100	he was in the golden country or he was sitting among enormous glorious sunlit ruins with his mother with julia with obriennot doing anything merely sitting in the sun talking of peaceful things
6101	such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams
6102	he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort now that the stimulus of pain had been removed
6103	he was not bored he had no desire for conversation or distraction
6104	merely to be alone not to be beaten or questioned to have enough to eat and to be clean all over was completely satisfying
6105	by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed
6106	all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body
6107	he would finger himself here and there trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter
6108	finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees
6109	after that reluctantly at first he began exercising himself regularly
6110	in a little while he could walk three kilometres measured by pacing the cell and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter
6111	he attempted more elaborate exercises and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do
6112	he could not move out of a walk he could not hold his stool out at arms length he could not stand on one leg without falling over
6113	he squatted down on his heels and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position
6114	he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands
6115	it was hopeless he could not raise himself a centimetre
6116	but after a few more daysa few more mealtimeseven that feat was accomplished
6117	a time came when he could do it six times running
6118	he began to grow actually proud of his body and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal
6119	only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror
6120	his mind grew more active
6121	he sat down on the plank bed his back against the wall and the slate on his knees and set to work deliberately at the task of reeducating himself
6122	he had capitulated that was agreed
6123	in reality as he saw now he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision
6124	from the moment when he was inside the ministry of loveand yes even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to dohe had grasped the frivolity the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party
6125	he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass
6126	there was no physical act no word spoken aloud that they had not noticed no train of thought that they had not been able to infer
6127	even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced
6128	they had played soundtracks to him shown him photographs
6129	some of them were photographs of julia and himself
6130	yes even
6131	he could not fight against the party any longer
6132	besides the party was in the right
6133	it must be so how could the immortal collective brain be mistaken
6134	by what external standard could you check its judgements
6135	sanity was statistical
6136	it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought
6137	only
6138	the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers
6139	he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head
6140	he wrote first in large clumsy capitals
6141	freedom is slavery
6142	then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it
6143	two and two make five
6144	but then there came a sort of check
6145	his mind as though shying away from something seemed unable to concentrate
6146	he knew that he knew what came next but for the moment he could not recall it
6147	when he did recall it it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be it did not come of its own accord
6148	he wrote
6149	god is power
6150	he accepted everything
6151	the past was alterable
6152	the past never had been altered
6153	oceania was at war with eastasia
6154	oceania had always been at war with eastasia
6155	jones aaronson and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with
6156	he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt
6157	it had never existed he had invented it
6158	he remembered remembering contrary things but those were false memories products of selfdeception
6159	how easy it all was
6160	only surrender and everything else followed
6161	it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it
6162	nothing had changed except your own attitude the predestined thing happened in any case
6163	he hardly knew why he had ever rebelled
6164	everything was easy except
6165	anything could be true
6166	the socalled laws of nature were nonsense
6167	the law of gravity was nonsense
6168	if i wished obrien had said i could float off this floor like a soap bubble
6169	winston worked it out
6170	if he thinks he floats off the floor and if i simultaneously think i see him do it then the thing happens
6171	suddenly like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water the thought burst into his mind it doesnt really happen
6172	we imagine it
6173	it is hallucination
6174	he pushed the thought under instantly
6175	the fallacy was obvious
6176	it presupposed that somewhere or other outside oneself there was a real world where real things happened
6177	but how could there be such a world
6178	what knowledge have we of anything save through our own minds
6179	all happenings are in the mind
6180	whatever happens in all minds truly happens
6181	he had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy and he was in no danger of succumbing to it
6182	he realized nevertheless that it ought never to have occurred to him
6183	the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself
6184	the process should be automatic instinctive
6185	crimestop they called it in newspeak
6186	he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop
6187	he presented himself with propositionsthe party says the earth is flat the party says that ice is heavier than waterand trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them
6188	it was not easy
6189	it needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation
6190	the arithmetical problems raised for instance by such a statement as two and two make five were beyond his intellectual grasp
6191	it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors
6192	stupidity was as necessary as intelligence and as difficult to attain
6193	all the while with one part of his mind he wondered how soon they would shoot him
6194	everything depends on yourself obrien had said but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer
6195	it might be ten minutes hence or ten years
6196	they might keep him for years in solitary confinement they might send him to a labourcamp they might release him for a while as they sometimes did
6197	it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again
6198	the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment
6199	the traditionthe unspoken tradition somehow you knew it though you never heard it saidwas that they shot you from behind always in the back of the head without warning as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell
6200	one daybut one day was not the right expression just as probably it was in the middle of the night oncehe fell into a strange blissful reverie
6201	he was walking down the corridor waiting for the bullet
6202	he knew that it was coming in another moment
6203	everything was settled smoothed out reconciled
6204	there were no more doubts no more arguments no more pain no more fear
6205	his body was healthy and strong
6206	he walked easily with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight
6207	he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the ministry of love he was in the enormous sunlit passage a kilometre wide down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs
6208	he was in the golden country following the foottrack across the old rabbitcropped pasture
6209	he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face
6210	at the edge of the field were the elm trees faintly stirring and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows
6211	suddenly he started up with a shock of horror
6212	the sweat broke out on his backbone
6213	he had heard himself cry aloud
6214	julia
6215	julia
6216	julia my love
6217	julia
6218	for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence
6219	she had seemed to be not merely with him but inside him
6220	it was as though she had got into the texture of his skin
6221	in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free
6222	also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help
6223	he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself
6224	what had he done
6225	how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness
6226	in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside
6227	they could not let such an outburst go unpunished
6228	they would know now if they had not known before that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them
6229	he obeyed the party but he still hated the party
6230	in the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity
6231	now he had retreated a step further in the mind he had surrendered but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate
6232	he knew that he was in the wrong but he preferred to be in the wrong
6233	they would understand thatobrien would understand it
6234	it was all confessed in that single foolish cry
6235	he would have to start all over again
6236	it might take years
6237	he ran a hand over his face trying to familiarize himself with the new shape
6238	there were deep furrows in the cheeks the cheekbones felt sharp the nose flattened
6239	besides since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth
6240	it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like
6241	in any case mere control of the features was not enough
6242	for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself
6243	you must know all the while that it is there but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name
6244	from now onwards he must not only think right he must feel right dream right
6245	and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him a kind of cyst
6246	one day they would decide to shoot him
6247	you could not tell when it would happen but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess
6248	it was always from behind walking down a corridor
6249	ten seconds would be enough
6250	in that time the world inside him could turn over
6251	and then suddenly without a word uttered without a check in his step without the changing of a line in his facesuddenly the camouflage would be down and bang
6252	would go the batteries of his hatred
6253	hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame
6254	and almost in the same instant bang
6255	would go the bullet too late or too early
6256	they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it
6257	the heretical thought would be unpunished unrepented out of their reach for ever
6258	they would have blown a hole in their own perfection
6259	to die hating them that was freedom
6260	he shut his eyes
6261	it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline
6262	it was a question of degrading himself mutilating himself
6263	he had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth
6264	what was the most horrible sickening thing of all
6265	he thought of big brother
6266	the enormous face because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro seemed to float into his mind of its own accord
6267	what were his true feelings towards big brother
6268	there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage
6269	the steel door swung open with a clang
6270	obrien walked into the cell
6271	behind him were the waxenfaced officer and the blackuniformed guards
6272	get up said obrien
6273	come here
6274	winston stood opposite him
6275	obrien took winstons shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely
6276	you have had thoughts of deceiving me he said
6277	that was stupid
6278	stand up straighter
6279	look me in the face
6280	he paused and went on in a gentler tone
6281	you are improving
6282	intellectually there is very little wrong with you
6283	it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress
6284	tell me winstonand remember no lies you know that i am always able to detect a lietell me what are your true feelings towards big brother
6285	i hate him
6286	you hate him
6287	good
6288	then the time has come for you to take the last step
6289	you must love big brother
6290	it is not enough to obey him you must love him
6291	he released winston with a little push towards the guards
6292	room he said
6293	chapter
6294	at each stage of his imprisonment he had known or seemed to know whereabouts he was in the windowless building
6295	possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure
6296	the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level
6297	the room where he had been interrogated by obrien was high up near the roof
6298	this place was many metres underground as deep down as it was possible to go
6299	it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in
6300	but he hardly noticed his surroundings
6301	all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him each covered with green baize
6302	one was only a metre or two from him the other was further away near the door
6303	he was strapped upright in a chair so tightly that he could move nothing not even his head
6304	a sort of pad gripped his head from behind forcing him to look straight in front of him
6305	for a moment he was alone then the door opened and obrien came in
6306	you asked me once said obrien what was in room
6307	i told you that you knew the answer already
6308	everyone knows it
6309	the thing that is in room is the worst thing in the world
6310	the door opened again
6311	a guard came in carrying something made of wire a box or basket of some kind
6312	he set it down on the further table
6313	because of the position in which obrien was standing
6314	winston could not see what the thing was
6315	the worst thing in the world said obrien varies from individual to individual
6316	it may be burial alive or death by fire or by drowning or by impalement or fifty other deaths
6317	there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing not even fatal
6318	he had moved a little to one side so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table
6319	it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by
6320	fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask with the concave side outwards
6321	although it was three or four metres away from him he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments and that there was some kind of creature in each
6322	they were rats
6323	in your case said obrien the worst thing in the world happens to be rats
6324	a sort of premonitory tremor a fear of he was not certain what had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage
6325	but at this moment the meaning of the masklike attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him
6326	his bowels seemed to turn to water
6327	you cant do that
6328	he cried out in a high cracked voice
6329	you couldnt you couldnt
6330	its impossible
6331	do you remember said obrien the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams
6332	there was a wall of blackness in front of you and a roaring sound in your ears
6333	there was something terrible on the other side of the wall
6334	you knew that you knew what it was but you dared not drag it into the open
6335	it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall
6336	obrien
6337	said winston making an effort to control his voice
6338	you know this is not necessary
6339	what is it that you want me to do
6340	obrien made no direct answer
6341	when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected
6342	he looked thoughtfully into the distance as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind winstons back
6343	by itself he said pain is not always enough
6344	there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain even to the point of death
6345	but for everyone there is something unendurablesomething that cannot be contemplated
6346	courage and cowardice are not involved
6347	if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope
6348	if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air
6349	it is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed
6350	it is the same with the rats
6351	for you they are unendurable
6352	they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wished to
6353	you will do what is required of you
6354	but what is it what is it
6355	how can i do it if i dont know what it is
6356	obrien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table
6357	he set it down carefully on the baize cloth
6358	winston could hear the blood singing in his ears
6359	he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness
6360	he was in the middle of a great empty plain a flat desert drenched with sunlight across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances
6361	yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him
6362	they were enormous rats
6363	they were at the age when a rats muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey
6364	the rat said obrien still addressing his invisible audience although a rodent is carnivorous
6365	you are aware of that
6366	you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town
6367	in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house even for five minutes
6368	the rats are certain to attack it
6369	within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones
6370	they also attack sick or dying people
6371	they show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless
6372	there was an outburst of squeals from the cage
6373	it seemed to reach winston from far away
6374	the rats were fighting they were trying to get at each other through the partition
6375	he heard also a deep groan of despair
6376	that too seemed to come from outside himself
6377	obrien picked up the cage and as he did so pressed something in it
6378	there was a sharp click
6379	winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair
6380	it was hopeless every part of him even his head was held immovably
6381	obrien moved the cage nearer
6382	it was less than a metre from winstons face
6383	i have pressed the first lever said obrien
6384	you understand the construction of this cage
6385	the mask will fit over your head leaving no exit
6386	when i press this other lever the door of the cage will slide up
6387	these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets
6388	have you ever seen a rat leap through the air
6389	they will leap on to your face and bore straight into it
6390	sometimes they attack the eyes first
6391	sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue
6392	the cage was nearer it was closing in
6393	winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head
6394	but he fought furiously against his panic
6395	to think to think even with a split second leftto think was the only hope
6396	suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils
6397	there was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him and he almost lost consciousness
6398	everything had gone black
6399	for an instant he was insane a screaming animal
6400	yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea
6401	there was one and only one way to save himself
6402	he must interpose another human being the body of another human being between himself and the rats
6403	the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else
6404	the wire door was a couple of handspans from his face
6405	the rats knew what was coming now
6406	one of them was leaping up and down the other an old scaly grandfather of the sewers stood up with his pink hands against the bars and fiercely sniffed the air
6407	winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth
6408	again the black panic took hold of him
6409	he was blind helpless mindless
6410	it was a common punishment in imperial china said obrien as didactically as ever
6411	the mask was closing on his face
6412	the wire brushed his cheek
6413	and thenno it was not relief only hope a tiny fragment of hope
6414	too late perhaps too late
6415	but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishmentone body that he could thrust between himself and the rats
6416	and he was shouting frantically over and over
6417	do it to julia
6418	do it to julia
6419	not me
6420	julia
6421	i dont care what you do to her
6422	tear her face off strip her to the bones
6423	not me
6424	julia
6425	not me
6426	he was falling backwards into enormous depths away from the rats
6427	he was still strapped in the chair but he had fallen through the floor through the walls of the building through the earth through the oceans through the atmosphere into outer space into the gulfs between the starsalways away away away from the rats
6428	he was light years distant but obrien was still standing at his side
6429	there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek
6430	but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open
6431	chapter
6432	the chestnut tree was almost empty
6433	a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty tabletops
6434	it was the lonely hour of fifteen
6435	a tinny music trickled from the telescreens
6436	winston sat in his usual corner gazing into an empty glass
6437	now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall
6438	big brother is watching you the caption said
6439	unbidden a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork
6440	it was saccharine flavoured with cloves the speciality of the cafe
6441	winston was listening to the telescreen
6442	at present only music was coming out of it but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace
6443	the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme
6444	on and off he had been worrying about it all day
6445	a eurasian army oceania was at war with eurasia oceania had always been at war with eurasia was moving southward at terrifying speed
6446	the midday bulletin had not mentioned any definite area but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield
6447	brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger
6448	one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant
6449	it was not merely a question of losing central africa for the first time in the whole war the territory of oceania itself was menaced
6450	a violent emotion not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement flared up in him then faded again
6451	he stopped thinking about the war
6452	in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time
6453	he picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp
6454	as always the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly
6455	the stuff was horrible
6456	the cloves and saccharine themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way could not disguise the flat oily smell and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin which dwelt with him night and day was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those
6457	he never named them even in his thoughts and so far as it was possible he never visualized them
6458	they were something that he was halfaware of hovering close to his face a smell that clung to his nostrils
6459	as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips
6460	he had grown fatter since they released him and had regained his old colourindeed more than regained it
6461	his features had thickened the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red even the bald scalp was too deep a pink
6462	a waiter again unbidden brought the chessboard and the current issue of the times with the page turned down at the chess problem
6463	then seeing that winstons glass was empty he brought the gin bottle and filled it
6464	there was no need to give orders
6465	they knew his habits
6466	the chessboard was always waiting for him his corner table was always reserved even when the place was full he had it to himself since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him
6467	he never even bothered to count his drinks
6468	at irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill but he had the impression that they always undercharged him
6469	it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about
6470	he had always plenty of money nowadays
6471	he even had a job a sinecure more highlypaid than his old job had been
6472	the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over
6473	winston raised his head to listen
6474	no bulletins from the front however
6475	it was merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty
6476	in the preceding quarter it appeared the tenth threeyear plans quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by per cent
6477	he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces
6478	it was a tricky ending involving a couple of knights
6479	white to play and mate in two moves
6480	winston looked up at the portrait of big brother
6481	white always mates he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism
6482	always without exception it is so arranged
6483	in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won
6484	did it not symbolize the eternal unvarying triumph of good over evil
6485	the huge face gazed back at him full of calm power
6486	white always mates
6487	the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteenthirty
6488	fifteenthirty
6489	this is news of the highest importance
6490	take care not to miss it
6491	fifteenthirty
6492	the tinkling music struck up again
6493	winstons heart stirred
6494	that was the bulletin from the front instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming
6495	all day with little spurts of excitement the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind
6496	he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the neverbroken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africa like a column of ants
6497	why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way
6498	the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in his mind
6499	he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board
6500	there was the proper spot
6501	even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force mysteriously assembled suddenly planted in their rear cutting their communications by land and sea
6502	he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence
6503	but it was necessary to act quickly
6504	if they could get control of the whole of africa if they had airfields and submarine bases at the cape it would cut oceania in two
6505	it might mean anything defeat breakdown the redivision of the world the destruction of the party
6506	he drew a deep breath
6507	an extraordinary medley of feelingbut it was not a medley exactly rather it was successive layers of feeling in which one could not say which layer was undermoststruggled inside him
6508	the spasm passed
6509	he put the white knight back in its place but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem
6510	his thoughts wandered again
6511	almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table
6512	they cant get inside you she had said
6513	but they could get inside you
6514	what happens to you here is for ever obrien had said
6515	that was a true word
6516	there were things your own acts from which you could never recover
6517	something was killed in your breast burnt out cauterized out
6518	he had seen her he had even spoken to her
6519	there was no danger in it
6520	he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings
6521	he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to
6522	actually it was by chance that they had met
6523	it was in the park on a vile biting day in march when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind
6524	he was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him
6525	it struck him at once that she had changed in some illdefined way
6526	they almost passed one another without a sign then he turned and followed her not very eagerly
6527	he knew that there was no danger nobody would take any interest in him
6528	she did not speak
6529	she walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side
6530	presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind
6531	they halted
6532	it was vilely cold
6533	the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional dirtylooking crocuses
6534	he put his arm round her waist
6535	there was no telescreen but there must be hidden microphones besides they could be seen
6536	it did not matter nothing mattered
6537	they could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to
6538	his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it
6539	she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm she did not even try to disengage herself
6540	he knew now what had changed in her
6541	her face was sallower and there was a long scar partly hidden by the hair across her forehead and temple but that was not the change
6542	it was that her waist had grown thicker and in a surprising way had stiffened
6543	he remembered how once after the explosion of a rocket bomb he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle which made it seem more like stone than flesh
6544	her body felt like that
6545	it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been
6546	he did not attempt to kiss her nor did they speak
6547	as they walked back across the grass she looked directly at him for the first time
6548	it was only a momentary glance full of contempt and dislike
6549	he wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes
6550	they sat down on two iron chairs side by side but not too close together
6551	he saw that she was about to speak
6552	she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig
6553	her feet seemed to have grown broader he noticed
6554	i betrayed you she said baldly
6555	i betrayed you he said
6556	she gave him another quick look of dislike
6557	sometimes she said they threaten you with something something you cant stand up to cant even think about
6558	and then you say dont do it to me do it to somebody else do it to soandso
6559	and perhaps you might pretend afterwards that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didnt really mean it
6560	but that isnt true
6561	at the time when it happens you do mean it
6562	you think theres no other way of saving yourself and youre quite ready to save yourself that way
6563	you want it to happen to the other person
6564	you dont give a damn what they suffer
6565	all you care about is yourself
6566	all you care about is yourself he echoed
6567	and after that you dont feel the same towards the other person any longer
6568	no he said you dont feel the same
6569	there did not seem to be anything more to say
6570	the wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies
6571	almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence besides it was too cold to keep still
6572	she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go
6573	we must meet again he said
6574	yes she said we must meet again
6575	he followed irresolutely for a little distance half a pace behind her
6576	they did not speak again
6577	she did not actually try to shake him off but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her
6578	he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable
6579	he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree cafe which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment
6580	he had a nostalgic vision of his corner table with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin
6581	above all it would be warm in there
6582	the next moment not altogether by accident he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people
6583	he made a halfhearted attempt to catch up then slowed down turned and made off in the opposite direction
6584	when he had gone fifty metres he looked back
6585	the street was not crowded but already he could not distinguish her
6586	any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers
6587	perhaps her thickened stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind
6588	at the time when it happens she had said you do mean it
6589	he had meant it
6590	he had not merely said it he had wished it
6591	he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the
6592	something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen
6593	a cracked and jeering note a yellow note came into it
6594	and thenperhaps it was not happening perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sounda voice was singing
6595	under the spreading chestnut tree
6596	i sold you and you sold me
6597	the tears welled up in his eyes
6598	a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle
6599	he took up his glass and sniffed at it
6600	the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank
6601	but it had become the element he swam in
6602	it was his life his death and his resurrection
6603	it was gin that sank him into stupor every night and gin that revived him every morning
6604	when he woke seldom before eleven hundred with gummedup eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight
6605	through the midday hours he sat with glazed face the bottle handy listening to the telescreen
6606	from fifteen to closingtime he was a fixture in the chestnut tree
6607	no one cared what he did any longer no whistle woke him no telescreen admonished him
6608	occasionally perhaps twice a week he went to a dusty forgottenlooking office in the ministry of truth and did a little work or what was called work
6609	he had been appointed to a subcommittee of a subcommittee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary
6610	they were engaged in producing something called an interim report but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out
6611	it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets or outside
6612	there were four others on the committee all of them persons similar to himself
6613	there were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done
6614	but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finishedwhen the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse with subtle haggling over definitions enormous digressions quarrelsthreats even to appeal to higher authority
6615	and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes like ghosts fading at cockcrow
6616	the telescreen was silent for a moment
6617	winston raised his head again
6618	the bulletin
6619	but no they were merely changing the music
6620	he had the map of africa behind his eyelids
6621	the movement of the armies was a diagram a black arrow tearing vertically southward and a white arrow horizontally eastward across the tail of the first
6622	as though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait
6623	was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist
6624	his interest flagged again
6625	he drank another mouthful of gin picked up the white knight and made a tentative move
6626	check
6627	but it was evidently not the right move because
6628	uncalled a memory floated into his mind
6629	he saw a candlelit room with a vast whitecounterpaned bed and himself a boy of nine or ten sitting on the floor shaking a dicebox and laughing excitedly
6630	his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing
6631	it must have been about a month before she disappeared
6632	it was a moment of reconciliation when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived
6633	he remembered the day well a pelting drenching day when the water streamed down the windowpane and the light indoors was too dull to read by
6634	the boredom of the two children in the dark cramped bedroom became unbearable
6635	winston whined and grizzled made futile demands for food fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall while the younger child wailed intermittently
6636	in the end his mother said now be good and ill buy you a toy
6637	a lovely toyyoull love it and then she had gone out in the rain to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders
6638	he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard
6639	it was a miserable outfit
6640	the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so illcut that they would hardly lie on their sides
6641	winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest
6642	but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play
6643	soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddlywinks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again almost to the startingpoint
6644	they played eight games winning four each
6645	his tiny sister too young to understand what the game was about had sat propped up against a bolster laughing because the others were laughing
6646	for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together as in his earlier childhood
6647	he pushed the picture out of his mind
6648	it was a false memory
6649	he was troubled by false memories occasionally
6650	they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were
6651	some things had happened others had not happened
6652	he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again
6653	almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter
6654	he had started as though a pin had run into him
6655	a shrill trumpetcall had pierced the air
6656	it was the bulletin
6657	victory
6658	it always meant victory when a trumpetcall preceded the news
6659	a sort of electric drill ran through the cafe
6660	even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears
6661	the trumpetcall had let loose an enormous volume of noise
6662	already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside
6663	the news had run round the streets like magic
6664	he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemys rear the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black
6665	fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din vast strategic manoeuvreperfect coordinationutter routhalf a million prisonerscomplete demoralizationcontrol of the whole of africabring the war within measurable distance of its endvictorygreatest victory in human historyvictory victory victory
6666	under the table winstons feet made convulsive movements
6667	he had not stirred from his seat but in his mind he was running swiftly running he was with the crowds outside cheering himself deaf
6668	he looked up again at the portrait of big brother
6669	the colossus that bestrode the world
6670	the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain
6671	he thought how ten minutes agoyes only ten minutesthere had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat
6672	ah it was more than a eurasian army that had perished
6673	much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love but the final indispensable healing change had never happened until this moment
6674	the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter but the shouting outside had died down a little
6675	the waiters were turning back to their work
6676	one of them approached with the gin bottle
6677	winston sitting in a blissful dream paid no attention as his glass was filled up
6678	he was not running or cheering any longer
6679	he was back in the ministry of love with everything forgiven his soul white as snow
6680	he was in the public dock confessing everything implicating everybody
6681	he was walking down the whitetiled corridor with the feeling of walking in sunlight and an armed guard at his back
6682	the longhopedfor bullet was entering his brain
6683	he gazed up at the enormous face
6684	forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache
6685	o cruel needless misunderstanding
6686	o stubborn selfwilled exile from the loving breast
6687	two ginscented tears trickled down the sides of his nose
6688	but it was all right everything was all right the struggle was finished
6689	he had won the victory over himself
6690	he loved big brother
6691	the end
6692	appendix
6693	the principles of newspeak
6694	newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc or english socialism
6695	in the year there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication either in speech or writing
6696	the leading articles in the times were written in it but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist
6697	it was expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak or standard english as we should call it by about the year
6698	meanwhile it gained ground steadily all party members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech
6699	the version in use in and embodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary was a provisional one and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later
6700	it is with the final perfected version as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary that we are concerned here
6701	the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc but to make all other modes of thought impossible
6702	it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten a heretical thoughtthat is a thought diverging from the principles of ingsocshould be literally unthinkable at least so far as thought is dependent on words
6703	its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods
6704	this was done partly by the invention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever
6705	to give a single example
6706	the word free still existed in newspeak but it could only be used in such statements as this dog is free from lice or this field is free from weeds
6707	it could not be used in its old sense of politically free or intellectually free since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts and were therefore of necessity nameless
6708	quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive
6709	newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum
6710	newspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it though many newspeak sentences even when not containing newlycreated words would be barely intelligible to an englishspeaker of our own day
6711	newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes known as the a vocabulary the b vocabulary also called compound words and the c vocabulary
6712	it will be simpler to discuss each class separately but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary since the same rules held good for all three categories
6713	the a vocabulary
6714	the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday lifefor such things as eating drinking working putting on ones clothes going up and down stairs riding in vehicles gardening cooking and the like
6715	it was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit run dog tree sugar house fieldbut in comparison with the presentday english vocabulary their number was extremely small while their meanings were far more rigidly defined
6716	all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them
6717	so far as it could be achieved a newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept
6718	it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion
6719	it was intended only to express simple purposive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actions
6720	the grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities
6721	the first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech
6722	any word in the language in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when could be used either as verb noun adjective or adverb
6723	between the verb and the noun form when they were of the same root there was never any variation this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms
6724	the word thought for example did not exist in newspeak
6725	its place was taken by think which did duty for both noun and verb
6726	no etymological principle was followed here in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention in other cases the verb
6727	even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected one or other of them was frequently suppressed
6728	there was for example no such word as cut its meaning being sufficiently covered by the nounverb knife
6729	adjectives were formed by adding the suffix ful to the nounverb and adverbs by adding wise
6730	thus for example speedful meant rapid and speedwise meant quickly
6731	certain of our presentday adjectives such as good strong big black soft were retained but their total number was very small
6732	there was little need for them since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding ful to a nounverb
6733	none of the nowexisting adverbs was retained except for a very few already ending in wise the wise termination was invariable
6734	the word well for example was replaced by goodwise
6735	in addition any wordthis again applied in principle to every word in the languagecould be negatived by adding the affix un or could be strengthened by the affix plus or for still greater emphasis doubleplus
6736	thus for example uncold meant warm while pluscold and doublepluscold meant respectively very cold and superlatively cold
6737	it was also possible as in presentday english to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante post up down etc
6738	by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary
6739	given for instance the word good there was no need for such a word as bad since the required meaning was equally wellindeed betterexpressed by ungood
6740	all that was necessary in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites was to decide which of them to suppress
6741	dark for example could be replaced by unlight or light by undark according to preference
6742	the second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity
6743	subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules
6744	thus in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in ed
6745	the preterite of steal was stealed the preterite of think was thinked and so on throughout the language all such forms as swam gave brought spoke taken etc being abolished
6746	all plurals were made by adding s or es as the case might be
6747	the plurals of man ox life were mans oxes lifes
6748	comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding er est good gooder goodest irregular forms and the more most formation being suppressed
6749	the only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns the relatives the demonstrative adjectives and the auxiliary verbs
6750	all of these followed their ancient usage except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary and the shall should tenses had been dropped all their uses being covered by will and would
6751	there were also certain irregularities in wordformation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech
6752	a word which was difficult to utter or was liable to be incorrectly heard was held to be ipso facto a bad word occasionally therefore for the sake of euphony extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained
6753	but this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the b vocabulary
6754	why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay
6755	the b vocabulary
6756	the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes words that is to say which not only had in every case a political implication but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them
6757	without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly
6758	in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak or even into words taken from the a vocabulary but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones
6759	the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language
6760	the b words were in all cases compound words
6761	compound words such as speakwrite were of course to be found in the a vocabulary but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour
6762	they consisted of two or more words or portions of words welded together in an easily pronounceable form
6763	the resulting amalgam was always a nounverb and inflected according to the ordinary rules
6764	to take a single example the word goodthink meaning very roughly orthodoxy or if one chose to regard it as a verb to think in an orthodox manner
6765	this inflected as follows nounverb goodthink past tense and past participle goodthinked present participle goodthinking adjective goodthinkful adverb goodthinkwise verbal noun goodthinker
6766	the b words were not constructed on any etymological plan
6767	the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation
6768	in the word crimethink thoughtcrime for instance the think came second whereas in thinkpol thought police it came first and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable
6769	because of the great difficulty in securing euphony irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary
6770	for example the adjective forms of minitrue minipax and miniluv were respectively minitruthful minipeaceful and minilovely simply because trueful paxful and loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce
6771	in principle however all b words could inflect and all inflected in exactly the same way
6772	some of the b words had highly subtilized meanings barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole
6773	consider for example such a typical sentence from a times leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc
6774	the shortest rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of english socialism
6775	but this is not an adequate translation
6776	to begin with in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc
6777	and in addition only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel which implied a blind enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today or of the word oldthink which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence
6778	but the special function of certain newspeak words of which oldthink was one was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them
6779	these words necessarily few in number had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term could now be scrapped and forgotten
6780	the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words but having invented them to make sure what they meant to make sure that is to say what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence
6781	as we have already seen in the case of the word free words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them
6782	countless other words such as honour justice morality internationalism democracy science and religion had simply ceased to exist
6783	a few blanket words covered them and in covering them abolished them
6784	all words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality for instance were contained in the single word crimethink while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink
6785	greater precision would have been dangerous
6786	what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew without knowing much else that all nations other than his own worshipped false gods
6787	he did not need to know that these gods were called baal osiris moloch ashtaroth and the like probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy
6788	he knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah he knew therefore that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods
6789	in somewhat the same way the party member knew what constituted right conduct and in exceedingly vague generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible
6790	his sexual life for example was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime sexual immorality and goodsex chastity
6791	sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever
6792	it covered fornication adultery homosexuality and other perversions and in addition normal intercourse practised for its own sake
6793	there was no need to enumerate them separately since they were all equally culpable and in principle all punishable by death
6794	in the c vocabulary which consisted of scientific and technical words it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations but the ordinary citizen had no need of them
6795	he knew what was meant by goodsexthat is to say normal intercourse between man and wife for the sole purpose of begetting children and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman all else was sexcrime
6796	in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent
6797	no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral
6798	a great many were euphemisms
6799	such words for instance as joycamp forcedlabour camp or minipax ministry of peace ie
6800	ministry of war meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean
6801	some words on the other hand displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society
6802	an example was prolefeed meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses
6803	other words again were ambivalent having the connotation good when applied to the party and bad when applied to its enemies
6804	but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning but from their structure
6805	so far as it could be contrived everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary
6806	the name of every organization or body of people or doctrine or country or institution or public building was invariably cut down into the familiar shape that is a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation
6807	in the ministry of truth for example the records department in which winston smith worked was called recdep the fiction department was called ficdep the teleprogrammes department was called teledep and so on
6808	this was not done solely with the object of saving time
6809	even in the early decades of the twentieth century telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations
6810	examples were such words as nazi gestapo comintern inprecorr agitprop
6811	in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose
6812	it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it
6813	the words communist international for instance call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flags barricades karl marx and the paris commune
6814	the word comintern on the other hand suggests merely a tightlyknit organization and a welldefined body of doctrine
6815	it refers to something almost as easily recognized and as limited in purpose as a chair or a table
6816	comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily
6817	in the same way the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth
6818	this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable
6819	in newspeak euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning
6820	regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary
6821	and rightly so since what was required above all for political purposes was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speakers mind
6822	the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike
6823	almost invariably these wordsgoodthink minipax prolefeed sexcrime joycamp ingsoc bellyfeel thinkpol and countless otherswere words of two or three syllables with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last
6824	the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech at once staccato and monotonous
6825	and this was exactly what was aimed at
6826	the intention was to make speech and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral as nearly as possible independent of consciousness
6827	for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary or sometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets
6828	his training fitted him to do this the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the words with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc assisted the process still further
6829	so did the fact of having very few words to choose from
6830	relative to our own the newspeak vocabulary was tiny and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised
6831	newspeak indeed differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year
6832	each reduction was a gain since the smaller the area of choice the smaller the temptation to take thought
6833	ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all
6834	this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak meaning to quack like a duck
6835	like various other words in the b vocabulary duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning
6836	provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones it implied nothing but praise and when the times referred to one of the orators of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment
6837	the c vocabulary
6838	the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms
6839	these resembled the scientific terms in use today and were constructed from the same roots but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings
6840	they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies
6841	very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech
6842	any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists
6843	only a very few words were common to all lists and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind or a method of thought irrespective of its particular branches
6844	there was indeed no word for science any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc
6845	from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions above a very low level was wellnigh impossible
6846	it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind a species of blasphemy
6847	it would have been possible for example to say big brother is ungood
6848	but this statement which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a selfevident absurdity could not have been sustained by reasoned argument because the necessary words were not available
6849	ideas inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so
6850	one could in fact only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak
6851	for example all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence but only in the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence
6852	it did not contain a grammatical error but it expressed a palpable untruthie
6853	that all men are of equal size weight or strength
6854	the concept of political equality no longer existed and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal
6855	in when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings
6856	in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished
6857	a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of politically equal or that free had once meant intellectually free than for instance a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook
6858	there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable
6859	and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of newspeak would become more and more pronouncedits words growing fewer and fewer their meanings more and more rigid and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing
6860	when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded the last link with the past would have been severed
6861	history had already been rewritten but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there imperfectly censored and so long as one retained ones knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them
6862	in the future such fragments even if they chanced to survive would be unintelligible and untranslatable
6863	it was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action or was already orthodox goodthinkful would be the newspeak expression in tendency
6864	in practice this meant that no book written before approximately could be translated as a whole
6865	prerevolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translationthat is alteration in sense as well as language
6866	take for example the wellknown passage from the declaration of independence
6867	we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
6868	that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their powers from the consent of the governed
6869	that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government
